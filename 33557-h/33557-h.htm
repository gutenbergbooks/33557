<h2>PROLOGUE
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />CLAIRE-DE-LUNE</span></h2>
</div>
<p>There was a big moon over the Bosphorus; the
limpid waters off Seraglio Point glimmered; the
Golden Horn was like a sheet of beaten silver
inset with topaz and ruby where lanterns on rusting
Turkish warships dyed the tarnished argent of the
flood. Except for these, and the fixed lights on the
foreign guard-ships and on a big American steam
yacht, only a pale and nebulous shoreward glow betrayed
the monster city.</p>
<p>Over Pera the full moon&#8217;s lustre fell, silvering palace,
villa, sea and coast; its rays glimmered on bridge and
wharf, bastion, tower arsenal, and minarette, transforming
those big, sprawling, ramshackle blotches of
architecture called Constantinople into that shadowy,
magnificent enchantment of the East, which all believe
in, but which exists only in a poet&#8217;s heart and mind.</p>
<p>Night veiled the squalour of Balat, and its filth, its
meanness, its flimsy sham. Moonlight made of Galata
a marvel, ennobling every bastard dome, every starved
façade, every unlovely and attenuated minarette, and
invested with added charm each really lovely ruin, each
tower, palace, mosque, garden wall and balcony, and
every crenelated battlement, where the bronze bulk of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
ancient cannon slanted, outlined in silver under the
Prophet&#8217;s moon.</p>
<p>Tiny moving lights twinkled on the Galata Bridge;
pale points of radiance dotted Scutari; but the group
of amazing cities called Constantinople lay almost
blotted out under the moon.</p>
<p>Darker at night than any capital in the world, its
huge, solid and ancient shapes bulking gigantic in the
night, its noble ruins cloaked, its cheap filth hidden,
its flimsy Coney Island aspect transfigured and the
stylographic-pen architecture of a hundred minarettes
softened into slender elegance, Constantinople lay
dreaming its immemorial dreams under the black
shadow of the Prussian eagle.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The German Embassy was lighted up like a Pera
café; the drawing-rooms crowded with a brilliant throng
where sashes, orders, epaulettes and sabre-tache glittered,
and jewels blazed and aigrettes waved under the
crystal chandeliers, accenting and isolating sombre
civilian evening dress, which seemed mournful, rusty,
and out of the picture, even when plastered over with
jewelled stars.</p>
<p>Few Turkish officials and officers were present, but
the disquieting sight of German officers in Turkish uniforms
was not uncommon. And the Count d&#8217;Eblis,
Senator of France, noted this phenomenon with lively
curiosity, and mentioned it to his companion, Ferez
Bey.</p>
<p>Ferez Bey, lounging in a corner with Adolf Gerhardt,
for whom he had procured an invitation, and
flanked by the Count d&#8217;Eblis, likewise a guest aboard
the rich German-American banker&#8217;s yacht, was very
much in his element as friend and mentor.</p>
<p>For Ferez Bey knew everybody in the Orient&mdash;knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
when to cringe, when to be patronising, when to fawn,
when to assert himself, when to be servile, when impudent.</p>
<p>He was as impudent to Adolf Gerhardt as he dared
be, the banker not knowing the subtler shades and differences;
he was on an equality with the French senator,
Monsieur le Comte d&#8217;Eblis because he knew that
d&#8217;Eblis dared not resent his familiarity.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in that brilliant company, Ferez Bey was
a jackal&mdash;and he knew it perfectly&mdash;but a valuable
jackal; and he also knew that.</p>
<p>So when the German Ambassador spoke pleasantly
to him, his attitude was just sufficiently servile, but not
overdone; and when Von-der-Hohe Pasha, in the uniform
of a Turkish General of Division, graciously exchanged
a polite word with him during a moment&#8217;s
easy gossip with the Count d&#8217;Eblis, Ferez Bey writhed
moderately under the honour, but did not exactly
squirm.</p>
<p>To Conrad von Heimholz he ventured to present his
German-American patron, Adolf Gerhardt, and the thin
young military attaché condescended in his Prussian
way to notice the introduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw your yacht in the harbour,&#8221; he admitted
stiffly. &#8220;It is astonishing how you Americans permit
no bounds to your somewhat noticeable magnificence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a good boat, the <i>Mirage</i>,&#8221; rumbled Gerhardt,
in his bushy red beard, &#8220;but there are plenty in America
finer than mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not many, Adolf,&#8221; insisted Ferez, in his flat, Eurasian
voice&mdash;&#8220;not ver&#8217; many anyw&#8217;ere so fine like your
<i>Mirage</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw none finer at Kiel,&#8221; said the attaché, staring
at Gerhardt through his monocle, with the habitual
insolence and disapproval of the Prussian junker. &#8220;To

me it exhibits bad taste&#8221;&mdash;he turned to the Count
d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;&#8220;particularly when the <i>Meteor</i> is there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked the Count.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Kiel. I speak of Kiel and the ostentation of
certain foreign yacht owners at the recent regatta.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerhardt, redder than ever, was still German enough
to swallow the meaningless insolence. He was not getting
on very well at the Embassy of his fellow countrymen.
Americans, properly presented, they endured
without too open resentment; for German-Americans,
even when millionaires, their contempt and bad manners
were often undisguised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get out of this,&#8221; growled Gerhardt,
who held a good position socially in New York and in
the fashionable colony at Northbrook. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
enough puffed up Germans and over-embroidered
Turks to last me. Come on, d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferez detained them both:</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;you would not miss Nihla!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla?&#8221; repeated d&#8217;Eblis, who had passed his arm
through Gerhardt&#8217;s. &#8220;Is that the girl who set St.
Petersburg by the ears?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla Quellen,&#8221; rumbled Gerhardt. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of
her. She&#8217;s a dancer, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferez, of course, knew all about her, and he drew
the two men into the embrasure of a long window.</p>
<p>It was not happening just exactly as he and the
German Ambassador had planned it together; they had
intended to let Nihla burst like a flaming jewel on the
vision of d&#8217;Eblis and blind him then and there.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, it was better drama to prepare
her entrance. And who but Ferez was qualified to prepare
that entrée, or to speak with authority concerning
the history of this strange and beautiful young
girl who had suddenly appeared like a burning star
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
in the East, had passed like a meteor through St.
Petersburg, leaving several susceptible young men&mdash;notably
the Grand Duke Cyril&mdash;mentally unhinged and
hopelessly dissatisfied with fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ver&#8217; fonny, d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;une histoire chic, vous
savez! Figurez vous&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk English,&#8221; growled Gerhardt, eyeing the serene
progress of a pretty Highness, Austrian, of
course, surrounded by gorgeous uniforms and empressement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Ferez turned; the gorgeous lady snubbed him, but
bowed to d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Archduchess Zilka,&#8221; he said, not a whit
abashed. &#8220;She is a ver&#8217; great frien&#8217; of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you present me?&#8221; enquired Gerhardt, restlessly;
&#8220;&mdash;or you, d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;can&#8217;t you ask permission?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Count d&#8217;Eblis nodded inattentively, then turned
his heavy and rather vulgar face to Ferez, plainly interested
in the &#8220;histoire&#8221; of the girl, Nihla.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you going to say about that dancer?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>
<p>Ferez pretended to forget, then, apparently recollecting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Apropos of Nihla? It is a ver&#8217; piquant storee&mdash;the
storee of Nihla Quellen. Zat is not &#8217;er name.
No! Her name is Dunois&mdash;Thessalie Dunois.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;French,&#8221; nodded d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alsatian,&#8221; replied Ferez slyly. &#8220;Her fathaire was
captain&mdash;Achille Dunois?&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed d&#8217;Eblis. &#8220;Do you mean that
notorious fellow, the Grand Duke Cyril&#8217;s hunting
cheetah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same, dear frien&#8217;. Dunois is dead&mdash;his bullet
head was crack open, doubtless by som&#8217; ladee&#8217;s angree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
husban&#8217;. There are a few thousan&#8217; roubles&mdash;not
more&mdash;to stan&#8217; between some kind gentleman and
the prettee Nihla. You see?&#8221; he added to Gerhardt,
who was listening without interest, &#8220;&mdash;Dunois, if he
was the Gran&#8217; Duke&#8217;s cheetah, kept all such merry
gentlemen from his charming daughtaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerhardt, whose aspirations lay higher, socially,
than a dancing girl, merely grunted. But d&#8217;Eblis,
whose aspirations were always below even his own level,
listened with visibly increasing curiosity. And this was
according to the programme of Ferez Bey and Excellenz.
As the Hun has it, &#8220;according to plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; enquired d&#8217;Eblis heavily, &#8220;did Cyril get
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All St. Petersburg is still laughing at heem,&#8221; replied
the voluble Eurasian. &#8220;Cyril indeed launched
her. And that was sufficient&mdash;yet, that first night she
storm St. Petersburg. And Cyril&#8217;s reward? Listen,
d&#8217;Eblis, they say she slapped his sillee face. For me,
I don&#8217;t know. That is the storee. And he was ver&#8217;
angree, Cyril. You know? And, by God, it was what
Gerhardt calls a &#8216;raw deal.&#8217; Yess? Figurez vous!&mdash;this
girl, déjà lancée&mdash;and her fathaire the Grand
Duke&#8217;s hunting cheetah, and her mothaire, what? Yes,
mon ami, a &#8217;andsome Géorgianne, caught quite wild,
they say, by Prince Haledine! For me, I believe it.
Why not?... And then the beautiful Géorgianne,
she fell to Dunois&mdash;on a bet?&mdash;a service rendered?&mdash;gratitude
of Cyril?&mdash;&mdash;Who knows? Only that
Dunois must marry her. And Nihla is their daughtaire.
Voilà!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why,&#8221; demanded d&#8217;Eblis, &#8220;does she make such
a fuss about being grateful? I hate ingratitude, Ferez.
And how can she last, anyway? To dance for
the German Ambassador in Constantinople is all very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
well, but unless somebody launches her properly&mdash;in
Paris&mdash;she&#8217;ll end in a Pera <ins title='Added missing quotes'>café.&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>Ferez held his peace and listened with all his might.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could do that,&#8221; added d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please?&#8221; inquired Ferez suavely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launch her in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>The programme of Excellenz and Ferez Bey was
certainly proceeding as planned.</p>
<p>But Gerhardt was becoming restless and dully irritated
as he began to realise more and more what caste
meant to Prussians and how insignificant to these
people was a German-American multimillionaire. And
Ferez realised that he must do something.</p>
<p>There was a Bavarian Baroness there, uglier than
the usual run of Bavarian baronesses; and to her
Ferez nailed Gerhardt, and wriggled free himself, making
his way amid the gorgeous throngs to the Count
d&#8217;Eblis once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left Gerhardt planted,&#8221; he remarked with satisfaction;
&#8220;by God, she is uglee like camels&mdash;the Baroness
von Schaunitz! Nev&#8217; mind. It is nobility; it is
the same to Adolf Gerhardt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A homely woman makes me sick!&#8221; remarked d&#8217;Eblis.
&#8220;Eh, mon Dieu!&mdash;one has merely to look at these
ladies to guess their nationality! Only in Germany
can one gather together such a collection of horrors.
The only pretty ones are Austrian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps even the cynicism of Excellenz had not
realised the perfection of this setting, but Ferez, the
nimble witted, had foreseen it.</p>
<p>Already the glittering crowds in the drawing rooms
were drawing aside like jewelled curtains; already the
stringed orchestra had become mute aloft in its gilded
gallery.</p>
<p>The gay tumult softened; laughter, voices, the rustle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
of silks and fans, the metallic murmur of drawing-room
equipment died away. Through the increasing
stillness, from the gilded gallery a Thessalonian reed
began skirling like a thrush in the underbrush.</p>
<p>Suddenly a sand-coloured curtain at the end of the
east room twitched open, and a great desert ostrich
trotted in. And, astride of the big, excited, bridled
bird, sat a young girl, controlling her restless mount
with disdainful indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla!&#8221; whispered Ferez, in the large, fat ear of
the Count d&#8217;Eblis. The latter&#8217;s pallid jowl reddened
and his pendulous lips tightened to a deep-bitten crease
across his face.</p>
<p>To the weird skirling of the Thessalonian pipe the
girl, Nihla, put her feathered steed through its absurd paces,
aping the haute-école.</p>
<p>There is little humour in your Teuton; they were
too amazed to laugh; too fascinated, possibly by the
girl herself, to follow the panicky gambols of the reptile-headed
bird.</p>
<p>The girl wore absolutely nothing except a Yashmak
and a zone of blue jewels across her breasts and hips.</p>
<p>Her childish throat, her limbs, her slim, snowy body,
her little naked feet were lovely beyond words. Her
thick dark hair flew loose, now framing, now veiling
an oval face from which, above the gauzy Yashmak&#8217;s
edge, two dark eyes coolly swept her breathless audience.</p>
<p>But under the frail wisp of cobweb, her cheeks
glowed pink, and two full red lips parted deliciously
in the half-checked laughter of confident, reckless
youth.</p>

<p class='caption'>
NIHLA PUT HER FEATHERED STEED THROUGH ITS ABSURD PACES<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Over hurdle after hurdle she lifted her powerful,
half-terrified mount; she backed it, pirouetted, made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
it squat, leap, pace, trot, run with wings half spread
and neck stretched level.</p>
<p>She rode sideways, then kneeling, standing, then
poised on one foot; she threw somersaults, faced to
the rear, mounted and dismounted at full speed. And
through the frail, transparent Yashmak her parted red
lips revealed the glimmer of teeth and her childishly
engaging laughter rang delightfully.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, she had enough of her bird; she
wheeled, sprang to the polished parquet, and sent her
feathered steed scampering away through the sand-coloured
curtains, which switched into place again
immediately.</p>
<p>Breathless, laughing that frank, youthful, irresistible
laugh which was to become so celebrated in Europe,
Nihla Quellen strolled leisurely around the circle of
her applauding audience, carelessly blowing a kiss or
two from her slim finger-tips, evidently quite unspoiled
by her success and equally delighted to please and to
be pleased.</p>
<p>Then, in the gilded gallery the strings began; and
quite naturally, without any trace of preparation or
self-consciousness, Nihla began to sing, dancing when
the fascinating, irresponsible measure called for it,
singing again as the sequence occurred. And the enchantment
of it all lay in its accidental and detached
allure&mdash;as though it all were quite spontaneous&mdash;the
song a passing whim, the dance a capricious after-thought,
and the whole thing done entirely to please
herself and give vent to the sheer delight of a young
girl, in her own overwhelming energy and youthful
spirits.</p>
<p>Even the Teuton comprehended that, and the applause
grew to a roar with that odd undertone of animal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
menace always to be detected when the German
herd is gratified and expresses pleasure en masse.</p>
<p>But she wouldn&#8217;t stay, wouldn&#8217;t return. Like one
of those beautiful Persian cats, she had lingered long
enough to arouse delight. Then she went, deaf to recall,
to persuasion, to caress&mdash;indifferent to praise, to
blandishment, to entreaty. Cat and dancer were similar;
Nihla, like the Persian puss, knew when she had
had enough. That was sufficient for her: nothing
could stop her, nothing lure her to return.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat were glistening upon the heavy features
of the Count d&#8217;Eblis. Von-der-Goltz Pasha,
strolling near, did him the honour to remember him,
but d&#8217;Eblis seemed dazed and unresponsive; and the
old Pasha understood, perhaps, when he caught the
beady and expressive eyes of Ferez fixed on him in
exultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose is she?&#8221; demanded d&#8217;Eblis abruptly. His
voice was hoarse and evidently out of control, for he
spoke too loudly to please Ferez, who took him by
the arm and led him out to the moonlit terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mon pauvere ami,&#8221; he said soothingly, &#8220;she is
actually the propertee of nobodee at present. Cyril,
they say, is following her&mdash;quite ready for anything&mdash;marriage&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferez shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the gosseep. No doubt som&#8217; man of wealth,
more acceptable to her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to meet her!&#8221; said d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! That is, of course, not easee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferez laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask yo&#8217;self the question again! Excellenz and his
guests have gone quite mad ovaire Nihla&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I care nothing for them,&#8221; retorted d&#8217;Eblis thickly;
&#8220;I wish to know her.... I wish to know her!...
<i>Do you understand?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>After a silence, Ferez turned in the moonlight and
looked at the Count d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your newspapaire&mdash;<i>Le Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.... If you get her for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sell to me for two million francs the control
stock in <i>Le Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; the two million, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall use my influence with Gerhardt. That is all
I can do. If your Emperor chooses to decorate him&mdash;something&mdash;the
Red Eagle, third class, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I attend to those,&#8221; smiled Ferez. &#8220;Hit&#8217;s ver&#8217; fonny,
d&#8217;Eblis, how I am thinking about those Red Eagles
all time since I know Gerhardt. I spik to Von-der-Goltz
de votre part, si vous le voulez? Oui? Alors&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her to supper aboard the yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Count d&#8217;Eblis said through closed teeth:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the first woman I ever really wanted in
all my life!... I am standing here now waiting for
her&mdash;waiting to be presented to her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spik to Von-der-Goltz Pasha,&#8221; said Ferez; and
he slipped through the palms and orange trees and
vanished.</p>
<p>For half an hour the Count d&#8217;Eblis stood there,
motionless in the moonlight.</p>
<p>She came about that time, on the arm of Ferez Bey,
her father&#8217;s friend of many years.</p>
<p>And Ferez left her there in the creamy Turkish
moonlight on the flowering terrace, alone with the
Count d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>When Ferez came again, long after midnight, with
Excellenz on one arm and the proud and happy Adolf
Gerhardt on the other, the whole cycle of a little
drama had been played to a conclusion between those
two shadowy figures under the flowering almonds on the
terrace&mdash;between this slender, dark-eyed girl and this
big, bulky, heavy-visaged man of the world.</p>
<p>And the man had been beaten and the girl had laid
down every term. And the compact was this: that
she was to be launched in Paris; she was merely to
borrow any sum needed, with privilege to acquit the
debt within the year; that, if she ever came to care
for this man sufficiently, she was to become only one
species of masculine property&mdash;a legal wife.</p>
<p>And to every condition&mdash;and finally even to the last,
the man had bowed his heavy, burning head.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Eblis!&#8221; began Gerhardt, almost stammering in
his joy and pride. &#8220;His highness tells me that I am
to have an order&mdash;an Imperial d-decoration&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Eblis stared at him out of unseeing eyes; Nihla
laughed outright, alas, too early wise and not even
troubling her lovely head to wonder why a decoration
had been asked for this burly, bushy-bearded man
from nowhere.</p>
<p>But within his sinuous, twisted soul Ferez writhed
exultingly, and patted Gerhardt on the arm, and patted
d&#8217;Eblis, too&mdash;dared even to squirm visibly closer
to Excellenz, like a fawning dog that fears too much
to venture contact in his wriggling demonstrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take with you our pretty wonder-child to
Paris to be launched, I hear,&#8221; remarked Excellenz, most
affably, to d&#8217;Eblis. And to Nihla: &#8220;And upon a yacht
fit for an emperor, I understand. Ach! Such a going
forth is only heard of in the Arabian Nights. Eh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
bien, ma petite, go West, conquer, and reign! It is
a prophecy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nihla threw back her head and laughed her full-throated
laughter under the Turkish moon.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Later, Ferez, walking with the Ambassador, replied
humbly to the curt question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have become his jackal. But always at the
orders of Excellenz.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Later still, aboard the <i>Mirage</i>, Ferez stood alone
by the after-rail, staring with ratty eyes at the blackness
beyond the New Bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, God, be merciful!&#8221; he whispered. He had often
said it on the eve of crime. Even an Eurasian rat has
emotions. And Ferez had been in love with Nihla many
years, and was selling her now at a price&mdash;selling her
and Adolf Gerhardt and the Count d&#8217;Eblis and France&mdash;all
he had to barter&mdash;for he had sold his soul too long
ago to remember even what he got for it.</p>
<p>The silence seemed more intense for the sounds that
made it audible. From, the unlighted cities on the
seven hills came an unbroken howling of dogs; transparent
waves of the limpid Bosphorus slapped the vessel&#8217;s
sides, making a mellow and ceaseless clatter. Far
away beyond Galata Quay, in the inner reek of unseen
Stamboul, the notes of a Turkish flute stole out across
the darkness, where some Tzigane&mdash;some unseen wretch
in rags&mdash;was playing the melancholy song of Mourad.
And, mournfully responsive to the reedy complaint
of a homeless wanderer from a nation without a home,
the homeless dogs of Islam wailed their miserere under
the Prophet&#8217;s moon.</p>
<p>The tragic wolf-song wavered from hill to hill; from
the Fields of the Dead to the Seven Towers, from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Kassim to Tophane, seeming to swell into one dreadful,
endless plaint:</p>
<p>&#8220;My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And me!&#8221; muttered Ferez, shivering in the windy
vapours from the Black Sea, which already dampened
his face with their creeping summer chill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned slowly. Swathed in a white wool bernous,
Nihla stood there in the foggy moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she enquired, without preliminaries and
with the unfeigned curiosity of a child.</p>
<p>He did not pretend to misunderstand her in French:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou knowest, Nihla. I have never touched thy
heart. I could do nothing for thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except to sell me,&#8221; she smiled, interrupting him in
English, without the slightest trace of accent.</p>
<p>But Ferez preferred the refuge of French:</p>
<p>&#8220;Except to launch thee and make possible thy
career,&#8221; he corrected her very gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were in love with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have loved thee, Nihla, since thy childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything on earth or in paradise, Ferez,
that you would not sell for a price?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell thee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zut! I know thee, Ferez!&#8221; she mocked him, slipping
easily into French. &#8220;What was my price? Who
pays thee, Colonel Ferez? This big, shambling, world-wearied
Count, who is, nevertheless, afraid of me? Did
he pay thee? Or was it this rich American, Gerhardt?
Or was it Von-der-Goltz? Or Excellenz?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla! Thou knowest me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her clear, untroubled laughter checked him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you, Ferez. That is why I ask. That is
why I shall have no reply from you. Only my wits
can ever answer me any questions.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>She stood laughing at him, swathed in her white
wool, looming like some mocking spectre in the misty
moonlight of the after-deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ferez,&#8221; she said in her sweet, malicious voice,
&#8220;there was a curse on Midas, too! You play at high
finance; you sell what you never had to sell, and you
are paid for it. All your life you have been busy
selling, re-selling, bargaining, betraying, seeking always
gain where only loss is possible&mdash;loss of all that justifies
a man in daring to stand alive before the God that
made him!... And yet&mdash;that which you call love&mdash;that
shadowy emotion which you have also sold to-night&mdash;I
think you really feel for me.... Yes, I believe it....
But it, too, has its price.... <i>What</i>
was that price, Ferez?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, Nihla&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ferez, you ask too much! No! Let <i>me</i> tell <i>you</i>,
then. The price was paid by that American, who is
not one but a German.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is absurd!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the Red Eagle, then? And the friendship of
Excellenz? What is he then, this Gerhardt, but a millionaire?
Why is nobility so gracious then? What
does Gerhardt give for his Red Eagle?&mdash;for the politeness
of Excellenz?&mdash;for the crooked smile of a Bavarian
Baroness and the lifted lorgnette of Austria? What
does he give for <i>me</i>? Who buys me after all? Enver?
Talaat? Hilmi? Who sells me? Excellenz? Von-der-Goltz?
You? And who pays for me? Gerhardt,
who takes his profit in Red Eagles and offers me to
d&#8217;Eblis for something in exchange to please Excellenz&mdash;and
you? And what, at the end of the bargaining,
does d&#8217;Eblis pay for me&mdash;pay through Gerhardt to
you, and through you to Excellenz, and through Excellenz
to the Kaiser Wilhelm II&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>Ferez, showing his teeth, came close to her and spoke
very softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;See how white is the moonlight off Seraglio Point,
my Nihla!... It is no whiter than those loveliest
ones who lie fathoms deep below these little silver
waves.... Each with her bowstring snug about her
snowy neck.... As fair and young, as warm and
fresh and sweet as thou, my Nihla.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at her; and if the smile stiffened an instant
on her lips, the next instant her light, dauntless laughter
mocked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a price,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you would sell even Life
to that old miser, Death! Then listen what you have
done, little smiling, whining jackal of his Excellency!
I go to Paris and to my career, certain of my happy
destiny, sure of myself! For my opportunity I pay
if I choose&mdash;pay <i>what</i> I choose&mdash;when and where it
suits me to pay!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped into French with a little laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go and lick thy fingers of whatever crumbs
have stuck there. The Count d&#8217;Eblis is doubtless licking
his. Good appetite, my Ferez! Lick away lustily,
for God does not temper the jackal&#8217;s appetite to his
opportunities!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferez let his level gaze rest on her in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, trafficker in Eagles, dealer in love, vendor of
youth, merchant of souls, what strikes you silent?&#8221;</p>
<p>But he was thinking of something sharper than her
tongue and less subtle, which one day might strike her
silent if she laughed too much at Fate.</p>
<p>And, thinking, he showed his teeth again in that
noiseless snicker which was his smile and laughter too.</p>
<p>The girl regarded him for a moment, then deliberately
mimicked his smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;The dogs of Stamboul laugh that way, too,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
said, baring her pretty teeth. &#8220;What amuses you?
Did the silly old Von-der-Goltz Pasha promise you,
also, a dish of Eagle?&mdash;old Von-der-Goltz with his
spectacles an inch thick and nothing living within what
he carries about on his two doddering old legs! There&#8217;s
a German!&mdash;who died twenty years ago and still walks
like a damned man&mdash;jingling his iron crosses and mumbling
his gums! Is it a resurrection from 1870 come
to foretell another war? And why are these Prussian
vultures gathering here in Stamboul? Can you tell
me, Ferez?&mdash;these Prussians in Turkish uniforms! Is
there anything dying or dead here, that these buzzards
appear from the sky and alight? Why do they crowd
and huddle in a circle around Constantinople? Is there
something dead in Persia? Is the Bagdad railroad
dying? Is Enver Bey at his last gasp? Is Talaat?
Or perhaps the savoury odour comes from the
Yildiz&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla! Is there nothing sacred&mdash;nothing thou fearest
on earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only old age&mdash;and thy smile, my Ferez. Neither
agrees with me.&#8221; She stretched her arms lazily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allons,&#8221; she said, stifling a pleasant yawn with one
slim hand,&#8220;&mdash;my maid will wake below and miss me;
and then the dogs of Stamboul yonder will hear a solo
such as they never heard before.... Tell me, Ferez,
do you know when we are to weigh anchor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At sunrise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the same to me,&#8221;&mdash;she yawned again&mdash;&#8220;my
maid is aboard and all my luggage. And my Ferez,
also.... Mon dieu! And what will Cyril have to
say when he arrives to find me vanished! It is, perhaps,
well for us that we shall be at sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her quick laughter pealed; she turned with a careless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
gesture of salute, friendly and contemptuous; and her
white bernous faded away in the moonlit fog.</p>
<p>And Ferez Bey stood staring after her out of his
near-set, beady eyes, loving her, desiring her, fearing
her, unrepentant that he had sold her, wondering
whether the day might dawn when he would find it best
to kill her for the prosperity and peace of mind of the
only living being in whose service he never tired&mdash;himself.</p>

</div>
<p>Three years later Destiny still wore a rosy face
for Nihla Quellen. And, for a young American
of whom Nihla had never even heard, Destiny
still remained the laughing jade he had always known,
beckoning him ever nearer, with the coquettish promise
of her curved forefinger, to fame and wealth immeasurable.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Seated now on a moonlit lawn, before his sketching
easel, this optimistic young man, whose name was
Barres, continued to observe the movements of a dim
white figure which had emerged from the villa opposite,
and was now stealing toward him across the dew-drenched
grass.</p>
<p>When the white figure was quite near it halted, holding
up filmy skirts and peering intently at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;May one look?&#8221; she inquired, in that now celebrated
voice of hers, through which ever seemed to sound a
hint of hidden laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he replied, rising from his folding camp
stool.</p>
<p>She tiptoed over the wet grass, came up beside him,
gazed down at the canvas on his easel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you really see to paint? Is the moon bright
enough?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But one has to be familiar with one&#8217;s palette.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh. You seem to know yours quite perfectly, monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to mix colours properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realise that painters ever actually painted
pictures by moonlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sort of hit or miss business, but the notes
made are interesting,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do with these moonlight studies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Use them as notes in the studio when a moonlight
picture is to be painted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you then a realist, monsieur?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As much of a realist as anybody with imagination
can be,&#8221; he replied, smiling at her charming, moonlit
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. Realism is merely honesty plus the
imagination of the individual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A delightful <i>mot</i>, madam&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; she corrected him demurely. &#8220;Are
you English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Then may I venture to converse with you in
English?&#8221; She said it in exquisite English, entirely
without accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> English!&#8221; he exclaimed under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ... I don&#8217;t know what I am.... Isn&#8217;t it
charming out here? What particular view are you
painting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Seine, yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent daintily over his sketch, holding up the
skirts of her ball-gown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sketch isn&#8217;t very far advanced, is it?&#8221; she
inquired seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>They stood there together in silence for a while,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
looking out over the moonlit river to the misty, tree-covered
heights.</p>
<p>Through lighted rows of open windows in the elaborate
little villa across the lawn came lively music and
the distant noise of animated voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he ventured smilingly, &#8220;that your
skirts and slippers are soaking wet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Isn&#8217;t this June night heavenly?&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced across at the lighted house. &#8220;It&#8217;s so hot
and noisy in there; one dances only with discomfort.
A distaste for it all sent me out on the terrace. Then
I walked on the lawn. Then I beheld you!... Am
I interrupting your work, monsieur? I suppose I am.&#8221;
She looked up at him naïvely.</p>
<p>He said something polite. An odd sense of having
seen her somewhere possessed him now. From the distant
house came the noisy American music of a two-step.
With charming grace, still inspecting him out of
her dark eyes, the girl began to move her pretty feet in
rhythm with the music.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we?&#8221; she inquired mischievously.... &#8220;Unless
you are too busy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The next moment they were dancing together there
on the wet lawn, under the high lustre of the moon,
her fresh young face and fragrant figure close to his.</p>
<p>During their second dance she said serenely:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll raise the dickens if I stay here any longer.
Do you know the Comte d&#8217;Eblis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Senator? The numismatist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know him. I am only a Latin Quarter
student.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is giving that party. He is giving it for
me&mdash;in my honour. That is his villa. And I&#8221;&mdash;she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
laughed&mdash;&#8220;am going to marry him&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>! Isn&#8217;t
this a delightful escapade of mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it rather an indiscreet one?&#8221; he asked smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frightfully. But I like it. How did you happen
to pitch your easel on his lawn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The river and the hills&mdash;their composition appealed
to me from here. It is the best view of the Seine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you glad you came?&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed at the mischievous question.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>During their third dance she became a little apprehensive
and kept looking over her shoulder toward the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man expected there,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;Ferez
Bey. He&#8217;s as soft-footed as a cat and he always
prowls in my vicinity. At times it almost seems to
me as though he were slyly watching me&mdash;as though he
were employed to keep an eye on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Turk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eurasian.... I wonder what they think of my
absence? Alexandre&mdash;the Comte d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;won&#8217;t like
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you better go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I ought to, but I won&#8217;t.... Wait a moment!&#8221;
She disengaged herself from his arms. &#8220;Hide
your easel and colour-box in the shrubbery, in case
anybody comes to look for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She helped him strap up and fasten the telescope-easel;
they placed the paraphernalia behind the blossoming
screen of syringa. Then, coming together, she
gave herself to him again, nestling between his arms
with a little laugh; and they fell into step once more
with the distant dance-music. Over the grass their
united shadows glided, swaying, gracefully interlocked&mdash;moon-born
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
phantoms which dogged their light young
feet....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A man came out on the stone terrace under the Chinese
lanterns. When they saw him they hastily backed
into the obscurity of the shrubbery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla!&#8221; he called, and his heavy voice was vibrant
with irritation and impatience.</p>
<p>He was a big man. He walked with a bulky, awkward
gait&mdash;a few paces only, out across the terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla!&#8221; he bawled hoarsely.</p>
<p>Then two other men and a woman appeared on the
terrace where the lanterns were strung. The woman
called aloud in the darkness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla! Nihla! Where are you, little devil?&#8221; Then
she and the two men with her went indoors, laughing
and skylarking, leaving the bulky man there alone.</p>
<p>The young fellow in the shrubbery felt the girl&#8217;s
hand tighten on his coat sleeve, felt her slender body
quiver with stifled laughter. The desire to laugh seized
him, too; and they clung there together, choking back
their mirth while the big man who had first appeared
waddled out across the lawn toward the shrubbery,
shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla! Where are you then?&#8221; He came quite close
to where they stood, then turned, shouted once or twice
and presently disappeared across the lawn toward a
walled garden. Later, several other people came out
on the terrace, calling, &#8220;Nihla, Nihla,&#8221; and then went
indoors, laughing boisterously.</p>
<p>The young fellow and the girl beside him were now
quite weak and trembling with suppressed mirth.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They had not dared venture out on the lawn, although
dance music had begun again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is it your name they called?&#8221; he asked, his eyes
very intent upon her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Nihla.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognise you now,&#8221; he said, with a little thrill
of wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; she replied with amiable indifference.
&#8220;Everybody knows me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not ask his name; he did not offer to enlighten
her. What difference, after all, could the name
of an American student make to the idol of Europe,
Nihla Quellen?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a mess,&#8221; she remarked presently. &#8220;He will
be quite furious with me. It is going to be most disagreeable
for me to go back into that house. He has
really an atrocious temper when made ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry,&#8221; he said, sobered by her seriousness.</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pouf! I really don&#8217;t care. But perhaps you
had better leave me now. I&#8217;ve spoiled your moonlight
picture, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But think what you have given me to make amends!&#8221;
he replied.</p>
<p>She turned and caught his hands in hers with adorable
impulsiveness:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sweet boy&mdash;do you know it! We&#8217;ve had
a heavenly time, haven&#8217;t we? Do you really think you
ought to go&mdash;so soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so, Nihla?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to go. Anyway, there&#8217;s a train
every two hours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a canoe down by the landing. I shall paddle
back as I came&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A canoe!&#8221; she exclaimed, enchanted. &#8220;Will you
take me with you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&#8220;To Paris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In your ball-gown?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d adore it! Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an absolutely crazy suggestion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. The world is only a big asylum. There&#8217;s
a path to the river behind these bushes. Quick&mdash;pick
up your painting traps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Nihla, dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please! I&#8217;m dying to run away with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Paris?&#8221; he demanded, still incredulous that the
girl really meant it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course! You can get a taxi at the Pont-au-Change
and take me home. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be wonderful, of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be paradise!&#8221; she exclaimed, slipping her
hand into his. &#8220;Now, let us run like the dickens!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the uncertain moonlight, filtering through the
shrubbery, they found a hidden path to the river; and
they took it together, lightly, swiftly, speeding down
the slope, all breathless with laughter, along the moonlit
way.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the suburban villa of the Comte d&#8217;Eblis a wine-flushed
and very noisy company danced on, supped at
midnight, continued the revel into the starlit morning
hours. The place was a jungle of confetti.</p>
<p>Their host, restless, mortified, angry, perplexed by
turns, was becoming obsessed at length with dull premonitions
and vaguer alarms.</p>
<p>He waddled out to the lawn several times, still wearing
his fancy gilt and tissue cap, and called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla! Damnation! Answer me, you little fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went down to the river, where the gaily painted
row-boats and punts lay, and scanned the silvered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
flood, tortured by indefinite apprehensions. About
dawn he started toward the weed-grown, slippery river-stairs
for the last time, still crowned with his tinsel
cap; and there in the darkness he found his aged boat-man,
fishing for gudgeon with a four-cornered net suspended
to the end of a bamboo pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you see anything of Mademoiselle Nihla?&#8221;
he demanded, in a heavy, unsteady voice, tremulous with
indefinable fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur le Comte, Mademoiselle Quellen went out
in a canoe with a young gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what is that you tell me!&#8221; faltered the Comte
d&#8217;Eblis, turning grey in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, about ten o&#8217;clock, M&#8217;sieu le Comte. I
was out in the moonlight fishing for eels. She came
down to the shore&mdash;took a canoe yonder by the willows.
The young man had a double-bladed paddle.
They were singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&mdash;they have not returned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, M&#8217;sieu le Comte&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the&mdash;man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; He turned and looked down the dusky
river out of light-coloured, murderous eyes. Then, always
awkward in his gait, he retraced his steps to the
house. There a servant accosted him on the terrace:</p>
<p>&#8220;The telephone, if Monsieur le Comte pleases&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is calling?&#8221; he demanded with a flare of fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paris, if it pleases Monsieur le Comte.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Count d&#8217;Eblis went to his own quarters, seated
himself, and picked up the receiver:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; he asked thickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Max Freund.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has h-happened?&#8221; he stammered in sudden
terror.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>Over the wire came the distant reply, perfectly clear
and distinct:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez Bey was arrested in his own house at dinner
last evening, and was immediately conducted to the
frontier, escorted by Government detectives.... Is
Nihla with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Count&#8217;s teeth were chattering now. He managed
to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know where she is. She was dancing.
Then, all at once, she was gone. Of what was Colonel
Ferez suspected?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But perhaps we might guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are <i>you</i> followed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By&mdash;by whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Souchez.... Good-bye, if I don&#8217;t see you. I
join Ferez. And look out for Nihla. She&#8217;ll trick you
yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Count d&#8217;Eblis called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, for God&#8217;s sake, Max!&#8221;&mdash;listened; called again
in vain. &#8220;The one-eyed rabbit!&#8221; he panted, breathing
hard and irregularly. His large hand shook as he
replaced the instrument. He sat there as though paralysed,
for a moment or two. Mechanically he removed
his tinsel cap and thrust it into the pocket of
his evening coat. Suddenly the dull hue of anger dyed
neck, ears and temple:</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;What is that she-devil trying
to do to me? What has she <i>done</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>After another moment of staring fixedly at nothing,
he opened the table drawer, picked up a pistol and
poked it into his breast pocket.</p>
<p>Then he rose, heavily, and stood looking out of the
window at the paling east, his pendulous under lip
aquiver.</p>

</div>
<p>The first sunbeams had already gilded her bedroom
windows, barring the drawn curtains with
light, when the man arrived. He was still wearing
his disordered evening dress under a light overcoat;
his soiled shirt front was still crossed by the red
ribbon of watered silk; third class orders striped his
breast, where also the brand new Turkish sunburst
glimmered.</p>
<p>A sleepy maid in night attire answered his furious
ringing; the man pushed her aside with an oath and
strode into the semi-darkness of the corridor. He was
nearly six feet tall, bulky; but his legs were either
too short or something else was the matter with them,
for when he walked he waddled, breathing noisily from
the ascent of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your mistress here?&#8221; he demanded, hoarse with
his effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&mdash;yes, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did she come in?&#8221; And, as the scared and
bewildered maid hesitated: &#8220;Damn you, answer me!
When did Mademoiselle Quellen come in? I&#8217;ll wring
your neck if you lie to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid began to whimper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur le Comte&mdash;I do not wish to lie to
you.... Mademoiselle Nihla came back with the
dawn&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>The maid wrung her hands:</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Monsieur le Comte m-mean to harm her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you answer me, you snivelling cat!&#8221; he panted
between his big, discoloured teeth. He had fished out
a pistol from his breast pocket, dragging with it a
silk handkerchief, a fancy cap of tissue and gilt, and
some streamers of confetti which fell to the carpet
around his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he breathed in a half-strangled voice, &#8220;answer
my questions. Was she alone when she came in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man?&#8221;</p>
<p>The maid trembled violently and nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M-Monsieur le Comte, I have never before beheld
him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not lie! I have never before seen him, Monsieur
le&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you learn his name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear what they said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They spoke in English&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; The man&#8217;s puffy face went flabby white,
and his big, badly made frame seemed to sag for a moment.
He laid a large fat hand flat against the wall,
as though to support and steady himself, and gazed
dully at the terrified maid.</p>
<p>And she, shivering in her night-robe and naked feet,
stared back into the pallid face, with its coarse,
greyish moustache and little short side-whiskers which
vulgarized it completely&mdash;gazed in unfeigned terror at
the sagging, deadly, lead-coloured eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is the man there&mdash;in there now&mdash;with her?&#8221; demanded
the Comte d&#8217;Eblis heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, monsieur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Monsieur le Comte, the young man stayed but
a moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were they? In her bedroom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the salon. I&mdash;I served a pâté&mdash;a glass of wine&mdash;and
the young gentleman was gone the next minute&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A dull red discoloured the neck and features of the
Count.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough,&#8221; he said; and waddled past her
along the corridor to the furthest door; and wrenched
it open with one powerful jerk.</p>
<p>In the still, golden gloom of the drawn curtains,
now striped with sunlight, a young girl suddenly sat
up in bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alexandre!&#8221; she exclaimed in angry astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You slut!&#8221; he said, already enraged again at the
mere sight of her. &#8220;Where did you go last night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing in my bedroom?&#8221; she demanded,
confused but flushed with anger. &#8220;Leave it!
Do you hear!&mdash;&#8221; She caught sight of the pistol in his
hand and stiffened.</p>
<p>He stepped nearer; her dark, dilated gaze remained
fixed on the pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; he said, the menacing roar rising in
his voice. &#8220;Where did you go last night when you left
the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I went out&mdash;on the lawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had had enough of your party: I came back to
Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>then</i>?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I came here, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, for the first time, she began to comprehend.
She swallowed desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was your companion?&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought him here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;came in&mdash;for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;never before saw him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You picked up a man in the street and brought him
here with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-not on the street&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the lawn&mdash;while your guests were dancing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you came to Paris with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t name him, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221; he yelled,
losing the last vestige of self-control. &#8220;What kind of
story are you trying to tell me, you lying drab! You&#8217;ve
got a lover! Confess it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liar! So this is how you&#8217;ve laughed at me, mocked
me, betrayed me, made a fool of me! You!&mdash;with your
fierce little snappish ways of a virgin! You with your
dangerous airs of a tiger-cat if a man so much as laid
a finger on your vicious body! So Mademoiselle-Don&#8217;t-touch-me
had a lover all the while. Max Freund warned
me to keep an eye on you!&#8221; He lost control of himself
again; his voice became a hoarse shout: &#8220;Max Freund
begged me not to trust you! You filthy little beast!
Good God! Was I crazy to believe in you&mdash;to talk
without reserve in your presence! What kind of imbecile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
was I to offer you marriage because I was crazy
enough to believe that there was no other way to possess
you! You&mdash;a Levantine dancing girl&mdash;a common
painted thing of the public footlights&mdash;a creature of
brasserie and cabaret! And you posed as Mademoiselle
Nitouche! A novice! A devotee of chastity! And, by
God, your devilish ingenuity at last persuaded me that
you actually were what you said you were. And all
Paris knew you were fooling me&mdash;all Paris was laughing
in its dirty sleeve&mdash;mocking me&mdash;spitting on
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All Paris,&#8221; she said, in an unsteady voice, &#8220;gave
you credit for being my lover. And I endured it. And
you knew it was not true. Yet you never denied it....
But as for me, I never had a lover. When I told
you that I told you the truth. And it is true to-day
as it was yesterday. Nobody believes it of a dancing
girl. Now, <i>you</i> no longer believe it. Very well, there
is no occasion for melodrama. I tried to fall in love
with you: I couldn&#8217;t. I did not desire to marry you.
You insisted. Very well; you can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not before I learn the name of your lover of last
night!&#8221; he retorted, now almost beside himself with
fury, and once more menacing her with his pistol. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get that much change out of all the money I&#8217;ve lavished
on you!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Tell me his name or I&#8217;ll kill
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached under her pillow, clutched a jewelled
watch and purse, and hurled them at him. She twisted
from her arm a gemmed bracelet, tore every flashing
ring from her fingers, and flung them in a handful
straight at his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some more change for you!&#8221; she panted.
&#8220;Now, leave my bedroom!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have that man&#8217;s name first!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>The girl laughed in his distorted face. He was
within an ace of shooting her&mdash;of firing point-blank
into the lovely, flushed features, merely to shatter them,
destroy, annihilate. He had the desire to do it. But her
breathless, contemptuous laugh broke that impulse&mdash;relaxed
it, leaving it flaccid. And after an interval something
else intervened to stay his hand at the trigger&mdash;something
that crept into his mind; something he had
begun to suspect that she knew. Suddenly he became
convinced that she <i>did</i> know it&mdash;that she believed that
he dared not kill her and stand the investigation of a
public trial before a <i>juge d&#8217;instruction</i>&mdash;that he could
not afford to have his own personal affairs scrutinised
too closely.</p>
<p>He still wanted to kill her&mdash;shoot her there where
she sat in bed, watching him out of scornful young
eyes. So intense was his need to slay&mdash;to disfigure,
brutalise this girl who had mocked him, that the raging
desire hurt him physically. He leaned back, resting
against the silken wall, momentarily weakened by the
violence of passion. But his pistol still threatened her.</p>
<p>No; he dared not. There was a better, surer way to
utterly destroy her,&mdash;a way he had long ago prepared,&mdash;not
expecting any such contingency as this, but
merely as a matter of self-insurance.</p>
<p>His levelled weapon wavered, dropped, held loosely
now. He still glared at her out of pallid and blood-shot
eyes in silence. After a while:</p>
<p>&#8220;You hell-cat,&#8221; he said slowly and distinctly. &#8220;Who
is your English lover? Tell me his name or I&#8217;ll beat
your face to a pulp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no English lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; he went on heavily, disregarding
her reply, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t know why you chose an Englishman?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
You thought you could blackmail me, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she demanded wearily.</p>
<p>Again he ignored her reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he one of the Embassy?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Is he
some emissary of Grey&#8217;s? Does he come from their
intelligence department? Or is he only a police jackal?
Or some lesser rat?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged; her night-robe slipped and she drew
it over her shoulder with a quick movement. And the
man saw the deep blush spreading over face and throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; he said, &#8220;you <i>are</i> an actress! I admit it.
But now you are going to learn something about real
life. You think you&#8217;ve got me, don&#8217;t you?&mdash;you and
your Englishman? Because I have been fool enough
to trust you&mdash;hide nothing from you&mdash;act frankly
and openly in your presence. You thought you&#8217;d get
a hold on me, so that if I ever caught you at your
treacherous game you could defy me and extort from
me the last penny! You thought all that out&mdash;very
thriftily and cleverly&mdash;you and your Englishman between
you&mdash;didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you? Then why did you ask me the other
day whether it was not German money which was paying
for the newspaper which I bought?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you that because Ferez Bey is notoriously
in Germany&#8217;s pay. And Ferez Bey financed the affair.
You said so. Besides, you and he discussed it
before me in my own salon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you suspected that I bought the <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>
with German money for the purpose of carrying out
German propaganda in a Paris daily paper?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why Ferez Bey gave you the money
to buy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not give me the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said so. Who did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You!</i>&#8221; he fairly yelled.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what!&#8221; stammered the girl, confounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me, you rat!&#8221; he said fiercely. &#8220;I was
not such a fool as you believed me to be. I lavished
money on you; you made a fortune for yourself out of
your popularity, too. Do you remember endorsing a
cheque drawn to your order by Ferez Bey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You had borrowed every penny I possessed.
You said that Ferez Bey owed you as much. So I accepted
his cheque&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That cheque paid for the <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>. It is drawn
to your order; it bears your endorsement; the <i>Mot
d&#8217;Ordre</i> was purchased in your name. And it was Max
Freund who insisted that I take that precaution. Now,
try to blackmail me!&mdash;you and your English spy!&#8221; he
cried triumphantly, his voice breaking into a squeak.</p>
<p>Not yet understanding, merely conscious of some
vague and monstrous danger, the girl sat motionless,
regarding him intently out of beautiful, intelligent
eyes.</p>
<p>He burst into laughter, made falsetto by the hysteria
of sheer hatred:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you are now!&#8221; he said, leering down
at her. &#8220;Every paper I ever made you sign incriminates
you; your cancelled cheque is in the same packet;
your <i>dossier</i> is damning and complete. You didn&#8217;t
know that Ferez Bey was sent across the frontier yesterday,
did you? Your English spy didn&#8217;t inform you
last night, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie! You <i>did</i> know it! That was why you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
stole away last night and met your jackal&mdash;to sell him
something besides yourself, this time! You knew they
had arrested Ferez! I don&#8217;t know how you knew it,
but you did. And you told your lover. And both of
you thought you had me at last, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;what are you trying to say to me&mdash;do to me?&#8221;
she stammered, losing colour for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put you where you belong&mdash;you dirty spy!&#8221; he said
with grinning ferocity. &#8220;If there is to be trouble, I&#8217;ve
prepared for it. When they try you for espionage,
they&#8217;ll try you as a foreigner&mdash;a dancing girl in the
pay of Germany&mdash;as my mistress whom Max Freund
and I discover in treachery to France, and whom I instantly
denounce to the proper authorities!&#8221;</p>
<p>He shoved his pistol into his breast pocket and put
on his marred silk hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you think they will believe&mdash;you or the
Count d&#8217;Eblis?&#8221; he demanded, the nervous leer twitching
at his heavy lips. &#8220;Which do you think they will
believe&mdash;your denials and counter-accusations against
me, or Max Freund&#8217;s corroboration, and the evidence
of the packet I shall now deliver to the authorities&mdash;the
packet containing every cursed document necessary
to convict you!&mdash;you filthy little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl bounded from her bed to the floor, her dark
eyes blazing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Get out of my bedroom!&#8221;</p>
<p>Taken aback, he retreated a pace or two, and, at
the furious menace of the little clenched fist, stepped
another pace out into the corridor. The door crashed
in his face; the bolt shot home.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In twenty minutes Nihla Quellen, the celebrated and
adored of European capitals, crept out of the street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
door. She wore the dress of a Finistère peasant; her
hair was grey, her step infirm.</p>
<p>The <i>commissaire</i>, two <i>agents de police</i>, and a Government
detective, one Souchez, already on their way
to identify and arrest her, never even glanced at the
shabby, infirm figure which hobbled past them on the
sidewalk and feebly mounted an omnibus marked Gare
du Nord.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For a long time Paris was carefully combed for the
dancer, Nihla Quellen, until more serious affairs occupied
the authorities, and presently the world at large.
For, in a few weeks, war burst like a clap of thunder
over Europe, leaving the whole world stunned and reeling.
The dossier of Nihla Quellen, the dancing girl,
was tossed into secret archives, together with the dossier
of one Ferez Bey, an Eurasian, now far beyond
French jurisdiction, and already very industrious in
the United States about God knows what, in company
with one Max Freund.</p>
<p>As for Monsieur the Count d&#8217;Eblis, he remained a
senator, an owner of many third-rate decorations, and
of the <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>.</p>
<p>And he remained on excellent terms with everybody
at the Swedish, Greek, and Bulgarian legations, and the
Turkish Embassy, too. And continued in cipher communication
with Max Freund and Ferez Bey in America.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he was still president of the Numismatic
Society of Spain, and he continued to add to his wonderful
collection of coins, and to keep up his voluminous
numismatic correspondence.</p>
<p>He was growing stouter, too, which increased his
spinal waddle when he walked; and he became very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
prosperous financially, through fortunate &#8220;operations,&#8221;
as he explained, with one Bolo Pasha.</p>
<p>He had only one regret to interfere with his sleep
and his digestion; he was sorry he had not fired his
pistol into the youthful face of Nihla Quellen. He
should have avenged himself, taken his chances, and
above everything else he should have destroyed her
beauty. His timidity and caution still caused him deep
and bitter chagrin.</p>
<p>For nearly a year he heard absolutely nothing concerning
her. Then one day a letter arrived from Ferez
Bey through Max Freund, both being in New York.
And when, using his key to the cipher, he extracted the
message it contained, he had learned, among other
things, that Nihla Quellen was in New York, employed
as a teacher in a school for dancing.</p>
<p>The gist of his reply to Ferez Bey was that Nihla
Quellen had already outlived her usefulness on earth,
and that Max Freund should attend to the matter at
the first favourable opportunity.</p>

<h2>III
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />SUNSET</span></h2>
</div>
<p>On the edge of evening she came out of the Palace
of Mirrors and crossed the wet asphalt, which
already reflected primrose lights from a clearing
western sky.</p>
<p>A few moments before, he had been thinking of her,
never dreaming that she was in America. But he knew
her instantly, there amid the rush and clatter of the
street, recognised her even in the twilight of the passing
storm&mdash;perhaps not alone from the half-caught
glimpse of her shadowy, averted face, nor even from
that young, lissome figure so celebrated in Europe.
There is a sixth sense&mdash;the sense of nearness to what
is familiar. When it awakes we call it premonition.</p>
<p>The shock of seeing her, the moment&#8217;s exciting incredulity,
passed before he became aware that he was
already following her through swarming metropolitan
throngs released from the toil of a long, wet day in
early spring.</p>
<p>Through every twilit avenue poured the crowds;
through every cross-street a rosy glory from the west
was streaming; and in its magic he saw her immortally
transfigured, where the pink light suffused the crossings,
only to put on again her lovely mortality in the
shadowy avenue.</p>
<p>At Times Square she turned west, straight into the
dazzling fire of sunset, and he at her slender heels, not
knowing why, not even asking it of himself, not thinking,
not caring.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>A third figure followed them both.</p>
<p>The bronze giants south of them stirred, swung their
great hammers against the iron bell; strokes of the
hour rang out above the din of Herald Square, inaudible
in the traffic roar another square away, lost,
drowned out long before the pleasant bell-notes penetrated
to Forty-second Street, into which they both
had turned.</p>
<p>Yet, as though occultly conscious that some hour
had struck on earth, significant to her, she stopped,
turned, and looked back&mdash;looked quite through him,
seeing neither him nor the one-eyed man who followed
them both&mdash;as though her line of vision were the East
itself, where, across the grey sea&#8217;s peril, a thousand
miles of cannon were sounding the hour from the North
Sea to the Alps.</p>
<p>He passed her at her very elbow&mdash;aware of her nearness,
as though suddenly close to a young orchard in
April. The girl, too, resumed her way, unconscious
of him, of his youthful face set hard with controlled
emotion.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man followed them both.</p>
<p>A few steps further and she turned into the entrance
to one of those sprawling, pretentious restaurants, the
sham magnificence of which becomes grimy overnight.
He halted, swung around, retraced his steps and followed
her. And at his heels two shapes followed them
very silently&mdash;her shadow and his own&mdash;so close together
now, against the stucco wall that they seemed
like Destiny and Fate linked arm in arm.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man halted at the door for a few moments.
Then he, too, went in, dogged by his sinister
shadow.</p>
<p>The red sunset&#8217;s rays penetrated to the rotunda and
were quenched there in a flood of artificial light; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
there their sun-born shadows vanished, and three
strange new shadows, twisted and grotesque, took their
places.</p>
<p>She continued on into the almost empty restaurant,
looming dimly beyond. He followed; the one-eyed man
followed both.</p>
<p>The place into which they stepped was circular, centred
by a waterfall splashing over concrete rocks. In
the ruffled pool goldfish glimmered, nearly motionless,
and mandarin ducks floated, preening exotic plumage.</p>
<p>A wilderness of tables surrounded the pool, set for
the expected patronage of the coming evening. The
girl seated herself at one of these.</p>
<p>At the next table he found a place for himself, entirely
unnoticed by her. The one-eyed man took the
table behind them. A waiter presented himself to take
her order; another waiter came up leisurely to attend
to him. A third served the one-eyed man. There were
only a few inches between the three tables. Yet the
girl, deeply preoccupied, paid no attention to either
man, although both kept their eyes on her.</p>
<p>But already, under the younger man&#8217;s spellbound
eyes, an odd and unforeseen thing was occurring: he
gradually became aware that, almost imperceptibly, the
girl and the table where she sat, and the sleepy waiter
who was taking her orders, were slowly moving nearer
to him on a floor which was moving, too.</p>
<p>He had never before been in that particular restaurant,
and it took him a moment or two to realise that
the floor was one of those trick floors, the central
part of which slowly revolves.</p>
<p>Her table stood on the revolving part of the floor,
his upon fixed terrain; and he now beheld her moving
toward him, as the circle of tables rotated on its axis,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
which was the waterfall and pool in the middle of the
restaurant.</p>
<p>A few people began to arrive&mdash;theatrical people, who
are obliged to dine early. Some took seats at tables
placed upon the revolving section of the floor, others
preferred the outer circles, where he sat in a fixed position.</p>
<p>Her table was already abreast of his, with only the
circular crack in the floor between them; he could easily
have touched her.</p>
<p>As the distance began to widen between them, the
girl, her gloved hands clasped in her lap, and studying
the table-cloth with unseeing gaze, lifted her dark eyes&mdash;looked
at him without seeing, and once more gazed
through him at something invisible upon which her
thoughts remained fixed&mdash;something absorbing, vital,
perhaps tragic&mdash;for her face had become as colourless,
now, as one of those translucent marbles, vaguely
warmed by some buried vein of rose beneath the snowy
surface.</p>
<p>Slowly she was being swept away from him&mdash;his gaze
following&mdash;hers lost in concentrated abstraction.</p>
<p>He saw her slipping away, disappearing behind the
noisy waterfall. Around him the restaurant continued
to fill, slowly at first, then more rapidly after the orchestra
had entered its marble gallery.</p>
<p>The music began with something Russian, plaintive
at first, then beguiling, then noisy, savage in its brutal
precision&mdash;something sinister&mdash;a trampling melody
that was turning into thunder with the throb of doom
all through it. And out of the vicious, Asiatic
clangour, from behind the dash of too obvious waterfalls,
glided the girl he had followed, now on her way
toward him again, still seated at her table, still gazing
at nothing out of dark, unseeing eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>It seemed to him an hour before her table approached
his own again. Already she had been served by a
waiter&mdash;was eating.</p>
<p>He became aware, then, that somebody had also
served him. But he could not even pretend to eat, so
preoccupied was he by her approach.</p>
<p>Scarcely seeming to move at all, the revolving floor
was steadily drawing her table closer and closer to his.
She was not looking at the strawberries which she was
leisurely eating&mdash;did not lift her eyes as her table swept
smoothly abreast of his.</p>
<p>Scarcely aware that he spoke aloud, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla&mdash;Nihla Quellen!...&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a flash the girl wheeled in her chair to face him.
She had lost all her colour. Her fork had dropped
and a blood-red berry rolled over the table-cloth toward
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said, flushing. &#8220;I did not mean to
startle you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl did not utter a word, nor did she move; but
in her dark eyes he seemed to see her every sense concentrated
upon him to identify his features, made shadowy
by the lighted candles behind his head.</p>
<p>By degrees, smoothly, silently, her table swept nearer,
nearer, bringing with it her chair, her slender person,
her dark, intelligent eyes, so unsmilingly and steadily
intent on him.</p>
<p>He began to stammer:</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;Two years ago&mdash;at&mdash;the Villa Tresse d&#8217;Or&mdash;on
the Seine.... And we promised to see each other&mdash;in
the morning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She said coolly:</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Thessalie Dunois. You mistake me for
another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, in a low voice, &#8220;I am not mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>Her brown eyes seemed to plunge their clear regard
into the depths of his very soul&mdash;not in recognition,
but in watchful, dangerous defiance.</p>
<p>He began again, still stammering a trifle:</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;In the morning, we were to&mdash;to meet&mdash;at eleven&mdash;near
the fountain of Marie de Médicis&mdash;unless you
do not care to remember&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that her gaze altered swiftly, melted into the exquisite
relief of recognition. Suspended breath, released,
parted her blanched lips; her little guardian
heart, relieved of fear, beat more freely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you now,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;You are Garret
Barres, of the rue d&#8217;Eryx.... You <i>are</i> Garry!&#8221;
A smile already haunted her dark young eyes; colour
was returning to lip and cheek. She drew a deep, noiseless
breath.</p>
<p>The table where she sat continued to slip past him;
the distance between them was widening. She had to
turn her head a little to face him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do remember me then, Nihla?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl inclined her head a trifle. A smile curved
her lips&mdash;lips now vivid but still a little tremulous from
the shock of the encounter.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I join you at your table?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, drew a deeper breath, looked down at the
strawberry on the cloth, looked over her shoulder at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You owe me an explanation,&#8221; he insisted, leaning
forward to span the increasing distance between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment, still studying him, she nodded as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
though the nod answered some silent question of her
own:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I owe you one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I join you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My table is more prudent than I. It is running
away from an explanation.&#8221; She fixed her eyes on her
tightly clasped hands, as though to concentrate
thought. He could see only the back of her head, white
neck and lovely dark hair.</p>
<p>Her table was quite a distance away when she turned,
leisurely, and looked back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She lifted her delicate brows in demure surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you,&#8221; she said, amiably.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man had never taken his eyes off them.</p>

<p>She had offered him her hand; he had bent over it,
seated himself, and they smilingly exchanged the
formal banalities of a pleasantly renewed acquaintance.</p>
<p>A waiter laid a cover for him. She continued to
concern herself, leisurely, with her strawberries.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you leave Paris?&#8221; she enquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly two years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before war was declared?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in June of that year.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him very seriously; but they both
smiled as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a momentous month for you then&mdash;the month
of June, 1914?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very. A charming young girl broke my heart in
1914; and so I came home, a wreck&mdash;to recuperate.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that she laughed outright, glancing at his youthful,
sunburnt face and lean, vigorous figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did <i>you</i> come over?&#8221; he asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been here longer than you have. In fact,
I left France the day I last saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I started that very same day&mdash;shortly after sunrise.
I crossed the Belgian frontier that night, and I
sailed for New York the morning after. I landed here
a week later, and I&#8217;ve been here ever since. That, monsieur,
is my history.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been here in New York for two years!&#8221; he
repeated in astonishment. &#8220;Have you really left the
stage then? I supposed you had just arrived to fill an
engagement here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They gave me a try-out this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You?</i> A try-out!&#8221; he exclaimed, amazed.</p>
<p>She carelessly transfixed a berry with her fork:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I secure an engagement I shall be very glad to
fill it ... and my stomach, also. If I don&#8217;t secure
one&mdash;well&mdash;charity or starvation confronts me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at her with easy incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had not heard that you were here!&#8221; he repeated.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve read nothing at all about you in the papers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No ... I am here incognito.... I have taken
my sister&#8217;s name. After all, your American public does
not know me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! I don&#8217;t wish it to know me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s slight gesture checked him, although her
smile became humorous and friendly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please! We need not discuss my future. Only the
past!&#8221; She laughed: &#8220;How it all comes back to me
now, as you speak&mdash;that crazy evening of ours together!
What children we were&mdash;two years ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>Smilingly she clasped her hands together on the
table&#8217;s edge, regarding him with that winning directness
which was a celebrated part of her celebrated personality;
and happened to be natural to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did I not recognise you immediately?&#8221; she demanded
of herself, frowning in self-reproof. &#8220;I <i>am</i>
stupid! Also I have, now and then, thought about
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She shrugged her shoulders, and again her
face faltered subtly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Much has happened to distract my memories,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
added carelessly, impaling a strawberry, &#8220;&mdash;since you
and I took the key to the fields and the road to the
moon&mdash;like the pair of irresponsibles we were that night
in June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you really had trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her slim figure straightened as at a challenge, then
became adorably supple again; and she rested her elbows
on the table&#8217;s edge and took her cheeks between
her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; she repeated, studying his face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know that word, trouble. I don&#8217;t admit such a word
to the honour of my happy vocabulary.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed a little.</p>
<p>She said, still looking at him, and at first speaking
as though to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you are that same, delightful Garry!
My youthful American accomplice!... Quite unspoiled,
still, but very, very irresponsible ... like all
painters&mdash;like all students. And the mischief which is
in me recognised the mischief in you, I suppose....
I <i>did</i> surprise you that night, didn&#8217;t I?... And what
a night! What a moon! And how we danced there on
the wet lawn until my skirts and slippers and stockings
were drenched with dew!... And how we laughed!
Oh, that full-hearted, full-throated laughter of ours!
How wonderful that we have lived to laugh like that!
It is something to remember after death. Just think
of it!&mdash;you and I, absolute strangers, dancing every
dance there in the drenched grass to the music that
came through the open windows.... And do you remember
how we hid in the flowering bushes when my
sister and the others came out to look for me? How
they called, &#8216;Nihla! Nihla! Little devil, where are you?&#8217;
Oh, it was funny&mdash;funny! And to see <i>him</i> come out on
the lawn&mdash;do you remember? He looked so fat and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
stupid and anxious and bad-tempered! And you and I
expiring with stifled laughter! And he, with his sash,
his decorations and his academic palms! He&#8217;d have
shot us both, you know....&#8221;</p>
<p>They were laughing unrestrainedly now at the memory
of that impossible night a year ago; and the girl
seemed suddenly transformed into an irresponsible
gamine of eighteen. Her eyes grew brighter with mischief
and laughter&mdash;laughter, the greatest magician
and doctor emeritus of them all! The immortal
restorer of youth and beauty.</p>
<p>Bluish shadows had gone from under her lower lashes;
her eyes were starry as a child&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry,&#8221; she gasped, laying one slim hand across
his on the table-cloth, &#8220;it was one of those encounters&mdash;one
of those heavenly accidents that reconcile one to
living.... I think the moon had made me a perfect
lunatic.... Because you don&#8217;t yet know what I
risked.... Garry!... It ruined me&mdash;ruined me utterly&mdash;our
night together under the June moon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he exclaimed, incredulously.</p>
<p>But she only laughed her gay, undaunted little laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was worth it! Such moments are worth anything
we pay for them! I laughed; I pay. What
of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I am partly responsible I wish to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall know nothing about it! As for me, I
care nothing about it. I&#8217;d do it again to-night! That
is living&mdash;to go forward, laugh, and accept what comes&mdash;to
have heart enough, gaiety enough, brains enough
to seize the few rare dispensations that the niggardly
gods fling across this calvary which we call life! <i>Tenez</i>,
that alone is living; the rest is making the endless stations
on bleeding knees.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yet, if I thought&mdash;&#8221; he began, perplexed and troubled,
&#8220;&mdash;if I thought that through my folly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Folly! <i>Non pas!</i> Wisdom! Oh, my blessed accomplice!
And do you remember the canoe? Were
we indeed quite mad to embark for Paris on the moonlit
Seine, you and I?&mdash;I in evening gown, soaked with dew
to the knees!&mdash;you with your sketching block and easel!
<i>Quelle déménagement en famille!</i> Oh, Garry, my friend
of gayer days, was that really folly! No, no, no, it
was infinite wisdom; and its memory is helping me to
live through this very moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned there on her elbows and laughed across
the cloth at him. The mockery began to dance again
and glimmer in her eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;After all I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you are no
wiser, are you? You don&#8217;t know why I never went to
the Fountain of Marie de Médicis&mdash;whether I forgot to
go&mdash;whether I remembered but decided that I had had
quite enough of you. You don&#8217;t know, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head, smiling. The girl&#8217;s face grew
gradually serious:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never heard anything more about me?&#8221;
she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Your name simply disappeared from the billboards,
kiosques, and newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you heard no malicious gossip? None about
my sister, either?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe is a senile creature which forgets overnight.
<i>Tant mieux</i>.... You know, I shall sing and dance
under my sister&#8217;s name here. I told you that, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That would be a great mistake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen! Nihla Quellen disappeared&mdash;married some
fat bourgeois, died, perhaps,&#8221;&mdash;she shrugged,&mdash;&#8220;anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
you wish, my friend. Who cares to listen to what
is said about a dancing girl in all this din of war?
Who is interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was scarcely a question, yet her eyes seemed to
make it so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares?&#8221; she repeated impatiently. &#8220;Who remembers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have remembered you,&#8221; he said, meeting her intently
questioning gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;You? Oh, you are not like those others over there.
Your country is not at war. You still have leisure to
remember. But they forget. They haven&#8217;t time to remember
anything&mdash;anybody&mdash;over there. Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221; She turned in her chair unconsciously, and
gazed eastward. &#8220;&mdash;They have forgotten me over
there&mdash;&#8221; And her lips tightened, contracted, bitten into
silence.</p>
<p>The strange beauty of the girl left him dumb. He
was recalling, now, all that he had ever heard concerning
her. The gossip of Europe had informed him that,
though Nihla Quellen was passionately and devotedly
French in soul and heart, her mother had been one of
those unmoral and lovely Georgians, and her father an
Alsatian, named Dunois&mdash;a French officer who entered
the Russian service ultimately, and became a hunting
cheetah for the Grand Duke Cyril, until himself hunted
into another world by that old bag of bones on the pale
and shaky nag. His daughter took the name of Nihla
Quellen and what money was left, and made her début
in Constantinople.</p>
<p>As the young fellow sat there watching her, all the
petty gossip of Europe came back to him&mdash;anecdotes,
panegyrics, eulogies, scandals, stage chatter, Quarter
&#8220;divers,&#8221; paid réclames&mdash;all that he had ever read and
heard about this notorious young girl, now seated there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
across the table, with her pretty head framed by slender,
unjewelled fingers. He remembered the gems she
had worn that June night, a year ago, and their magnificence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;life is a pleasantry, a jest, a bon-mot
flung over his shoulder by some god too drunk with
nectar to invent a better joke. Life is an Olympian
epigram made between immortal yawns. What do you
think of <i>my</i> epigram, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are just as clever and amusing as I
remember you, Nihla.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amusing to <i>you</i>, perhaps. But I don&#8217;t entertain
myself very successfully. I don&#8217;t think poverty is a
very funny joke. Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poverty!&#8221; he repeated, smiling his unbelief.</p>
<p>She smiled too, displayed her pretty, ringless hands
humorously, for his inspection, then framed her oval
face between them again and made a deliberate grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;All gone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am, as you say, here on my
uppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand, Nihla&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to. It doesn&#8217;t concern you. Also, please
forget me as Nihla Quellen. I told you that I&#8217;ve taken
my sister&#8217;s name, Thessalie Dunois.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But all Europe knows you as Nihla Quellen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; she interrupted sharply. &#8220;I have troubles
enough. Don&#8217;t add to them, or I shall be sorry I met
you again. I tell you my name is Thessa. Please remember
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, reddening under the rebuke.</p>
<p>She noted the painful colour in his face, then looked
elsewhere, indifferently. Her features remained expressionless
for a while. After a few moments she looked
around at him again, and her smile began to glimmer:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only this,&#8221; she said; &#8220;the girl you met once in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
your life&mdash;the dancing singing-girl they knew over
there&mdash;is already an episode to be forgotten. End her
career any way you wish, Garry,&mdash;natural death, suicide&mdash;or
she can repent and take the veil, if you like&mdash;or perish
at sea&mdash;only end her.... Please?&#8221; she
added, with the sweet, trailing inflection characteristic
of her.</p>
<p>He nodded. The girl smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t nod your head so owlishly and pretend to understand.
You don&#8217;t understand. Only two or three
people do. And I hope they&#8217;ll believe me dead, even if
you are not polite enough to agree with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you expect to maintain your incognito?&#8221;
he insisted. &#8220;There will be plenty of people in your
very first audience&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a sister, did I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Was</i> she your sister?&mdash;the one who danced with
you&mdash;the one called Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But the play-bills said she was. Now, I&#8217;ve
told you something that nobody knows except two or
three unpleasant devils&mdash;&#8221; She dropped her arms on
the table and leaned a trifle forward:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pouf!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s be mysterious
and dramatic, you and I. I&#8217;ll tell you: I gave that
woman the last of my jewels and she promised to disappear
and leave her name to me to use. It was my
own name, anyway, Thessalie Dunois. Now, you know.
Be as discreet and nice as I once found you. Will
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course,&#8217;&#8221; she repeated, smiling, and with a little
twitch of her shoulders, as though letting fall a burdensome
cloak. &#8220;Allons! With a free heart, then! I
am Thessalie Dunois; I am here; I am poor&mdash;don&#8217;t be
frightened! I shall not borrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rotten, Thessa!&#8221; he said, turning very red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go lightly, please, my friend Garry. I have no
claim on you. Besides, I know men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t appear to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tiens! Our first quarrel!&#8221; she exclaimed, laughingly.
&#8220;This is indeed serious&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you need aid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t! Please, why do you scowl at me? Do
you then wish I needed aid? Yours? Allez, Monsieur
Garry, if I did I&#8217;d venture, perhaps, to say so to you.
Does that make amends?&#8221; she added sweetly.</p>
<p>She clasped her white hands on the cloth and looked
at him with that engaging, humorous little air which
had so easily captivated her audiences in Europe&mdash;that,
and her voice with the hint of recklessness ever
echoing through its sweetness and youthful gaiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing in New York?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Painting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a studio, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But no clients? Is that it? Pouf! Everybody begins
that way. I sang in a café at Dijon for five francs
and my soup! At Rennes I nearly starved. Oh, yes,
Garry, in spite of a number of obliging gentlemen who,
like you, offered&mdash;first aid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is absolutely rotten of you, Thessa. Did I
ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! For goodness&#8217; sake let me jest with you without
flying into tempers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pouf! I shall not quarrel with you! Whatever
you and I were going to say during the next ten minutes
shall remain unsaid!... Now, the ten minutes are
over; now, we&#8217;re reconciled and you are in good humour
again. And now, tell me about yourself, your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
painting&mdash;in other words, tell me the things about yourself
that would interest a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend? Yes, I am&mdash;if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am your friend. I once had a wonderful
evening with you.... I&#8217;m having a very good time
now. You were <i>nice</i> to me, Garry. I really was sorry
not to see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the fountain of Marie de Médicis,&#8221; he said reproachfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Flatter yourself, monsieur, because I did <i>not</i>
forget our rendezvous. I might have forgotten it easily
enough&mdash;there was sufficient excuse, God knows&mdash;a girl
awakened by the crash of ruin&mdash;springing out of bed
to face the end of the world without a moment&#8217;s warning&mdash;yes,
the end of all things&mdash;death, too! Tenez, it
was permissible to forget our rendezvous under such
circumstances, was it not? But&mdash;I did <i>not</i> forget. I
thought about it in a dumb, calm way all the while&mdash;even
while <i>he</i> stood there denouncing me, threatening
me, noisy, furious&mdash;with the button of the Legion in
his lapel&mdash;and an ugly pistol which he waved in the
air&mdash;&#8221; She laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was not at all gay, I assure you.... And
even when I took to my heels after he had gone&mdash;for
it was a matter of life or death, and I hadn&#8217;t a minute
to lose&mdash;oh, very dramatic, of course, for I ran away
in disguise and I had a frightful time of it leaving
France! Well, even then, at top speed and scared to
death, I remembered the fountain of Marie de Médicis,
and you. Don&#8217;t be too deeply flattered. I remembered
these items principally because they had caused my
downfall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? I caused&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No. <i>I</i> caused it! It was I who went out on the
lawn. It was I who came across to see who was painting
by moonlight. That began it&mdash;seeing you there&mdash;in
moonlight bright enough to read by&mdash;bright enough
to paint by. Oh, Garry&mdash;and you were <i>so</i> good-looking!
It was the moon&mdash;and the way you smiled at me.
And they all were dancing inside, and <i>he</i> was so big
and fat and complacent, dancing away in there!...
And so I fell a prey to folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it really our escapade that&mdash;that ruined you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;it was partly that. Pouf! It is over. And
I am here. So are you. It&#8217;s been nice to see you....
Please call our waiter.&#8221; She glanced at her
cheap, leather wrist watch.</p>
<p>As they rose and left the dining-room, he asked her
if they were not to see each other again. A one-eyed
man, close behind them, listened for her reply.</p>
<p>She continued to walk on slowly beside him without
answering, until they reached the rotunda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to see me again?&#8221; she enquired abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you also wish it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Garry.... I&#8217;ve been annoyed in
New York&mdash;bothered&mdash;seriously.... I can&#8217;t explain,
but somehow&mdash;I don&#8217;t seem to wish to begin a friendship
with anybody....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ours began two years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it not, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.... I don&#8217;t know. After all&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t
matter. I think&mdash;I think we had better say good-bye&mdash;until
some happy hazard&mdash;like to-day&#8217;s encounter&mdash;&#8221;
She hesitated, looked up at him, laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your studio?&#8221; she asked mischievously.</p>
<p>The one-eyed man at their heels was listening.</p>

<h2>V
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />IN DRAGON COURT</span></h2>
</div>
<p>There was a young moon in the southwest&mdash;a
slender tracery in the April twilight&mdash;curved
high over his right shoulder as he walked northward
and homeward through the flare of Broadway.</p>
<p>His thoughts were still occupied with the pleasant
excitement of his encounter with Thessalie Dunois; his
mind and heart still responded to the delightful stimulation.
Out of an already half-forgotten realm of romance,
where, often now, he found it increasingly difficult
to realise that he had lived for five happy years,
a young girl had suddenly emerged as bodily witness,
to corroborate, revive, and refresh his fading faith in
the reality of what once had been.</p>
<p>Five years in France!&mdash;France with its clear sun
and lovely moon; <ins title='Was it'>its</ins> silver-grey cities, its lilac haze, its
sweet, deep greenness, its atmosphere of living light!&mdash;France,
the dwelling-place of God in all His myriad
aspects&mdash;in all His protean forms! France, the sanctuary
of Truth and all her ancient and her future
liberties; France, blossoming domain of Love in Love&#8217;s
million exquisite transfigurations, wherein only the eye
of faith can recognise the winged god amid his camouflage!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Wine-strong winds of the Western World, and a pitiless
Western sun which etches every contour with terrible
precision, leaving nothing to imagination&mdash;no delicate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
mystery to rest and shelter souls&mdash;had swept away
and partly erased from his mind the actuality of those
five past years.</p>
<p>Already that past, of which he had been a part, was
becoming disturbingly unreal to him. Phantoms
haunted its ever-paling sunlight; its scenes were fading;
its voices grew vague and distant; its hushed
laughter dwindled to a whisper, dying like a sigh.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, against that misty tapestry of tinted
spectres, appeared Thessalie Dunois in the flesh!&mdash;straight
out of the phantom-haunted void had stepped
this glowing thing of life! Into the raw reek and familiar
dissonance of Broadway she had vanished. Small
wonder that he had followed her to keep in touch with
the vanishing past, as a sleeper, waking against his will,
strives still to grasp the fragile fabric of a happy
dream.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of Thessalie, in spite of dreams, in spite
of his own home-coming, and the touch of familiar
pavements under his own feet, the past, to Barres, was
utterly dead, the present strange and unreal, the future
obscure and all aflame behind a world afire with war.</p>
<p>For two years, now, no human mind in America had
been able to adjust itself to the new heaven and the
new earth which had sprung into lurid being at the
thunderclap of war.</p>
<p>All things familiar had changed in the twinkling of
an eye; all former things had passed away, leaving the
stunned brain of humanity dulled under the shock.</p>
<p>Slowly, by degrees, the world was beginning to realise
that the civilisation of Christ was being menaced once
again by a resurgence from that ancient land of legend
where the wild Hun denned;&mdash;that again the endless
hordes of barbarians were rushing in on Europe out
of their Eastern fastnesses&mdash;hordes which filled the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
shrinking skies with their clamour, vaunting the might
of Baal, cheering their antichrist, drenching the knees
of their own red gods with the blood of little children.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible for Americans to understand
that these things could be&mdash;were really true&mdash;that the
horrors the papers printed were actualities happening
to civilised people like themselves and their neighbours.</p>
<p>Out of their own mouths the German tribes thundered
their own disgrace and condemnation, yet America
sat dazed, incredulous, motionless. Emperor and
general, professor and junker, shouted at the top of
their lungs the new creed, horrible as the Black Mass,
reversing every precept taught by Christ.</p>
<p>Millions of Teuton mouths cheered fiercely for the
new religion&mdash;Frightfulness; worshipped with frantic
yells the new trinity&mdash;Wotan, Kaiser and Brute
Strength.</p>
<p><ins title='Was Stunnned'>Stunned</ins>, blinded, deafened, the Western World, still
half-paralysed, stirred stiffly from its inertia. Slowly,
mechanically, its arteries resumed their functions; the
reflex, operating automatically, started trade again in
its old channels; old habits were timidly resumed; minds
groped backward, searching for severed threads which
connected yesterday with to-day&mdash;groped, hunted,
found nothing, and, perplexed, turned slowly toward
the smoke-choked future for some reason for it all&mdash;some
outlook.</p>
<p>There was no explanation, no outlook&mdash;nothing save
dust and flame and the din of Teutonic hordes trampling
to death the Son of Man.</p>
<p>So America moved about her worn, deep-trodden and
familiar ways, her mind slowly clearing from the cataclysmic
concussion, her power of vision gradually returning,
adjusting itself, little by little, to this new
heaven and new earth and this hell entirely new.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>The <i>Lusitania</i> went down; the Great Republic merely
quivered. Other ships followed; only a low murmur
of pain came from the Western Colossus.</p>
<p>But now, after the second year, through the thickening
nightmare the Great Republic groaned aloud; and
a new note of menace sounded in her drugged and
dreary voice.</p>
<p>And the thick ears of the Hun twitched and he
paused, squatting belly-deep in blood, to listen.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres walked homeward. Somewhere along in the
40&#8217;s he turned eastward into one of those cross-streets
originally built up of brownstone dwelling houses, and
now in process of transformation into that architectural
and commercial miscellany which marks the transition
stage of the metropolis anywhere from Westchester
to the sea.</p>
<p>Altered for business purposes, basements displayed
signs and merchandise of bootmakers, dealers in oriental
porcelains, rare prints, silverware; parlour windows
modified into bay windows, sheeted with plate-glass, exposed,
perhaps, feminine headgear, or an expensive
model gown or two, or the sign of a real-estate man,
or of an upholsterer.</p>
<p>Above the parlour floors lived people of one sort or
another; furnished and unfurnished rooms and suites
prevailed; and the brownstone monotony was already
indented along the building line by brand-new constructions
of Indiana limestone, behind the glittering plate-glass
of which were to be seen reticent displays of
artistic furniture, modern and antique oil paintings,
here and there the lace-curtained den of some superior
ladies&#8217; hair-dresser, where beautifying also was accomplished
at a price, alas!</p>
<p>Halfway between Sixth Avenue and Fifth, on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
north side of the street, an enterprising architect had
purchased half a dozen squatty, three-storied houses,
set back from the sidewalk behind grass-plots. These
had been lavishly stuccoed and transformed into abodes
for those irregulars in the army of life known as
&#8220;artists.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the rear the back fences had been levelled; six
corresponding houses on the next street had been purchased;
a sort of inner court established, with a common
grass-plot planted with trees and embellished by a
number of concrete works of art, battered statues, sundials,
and well-curbs.</p>
<p>Always the army of civilisation trudges along
screened, flanked, and tagged after by life&#8217;s irregulars,
who cannot or will not conform to routine. And these
are always roaming around seeking their own cantonments,
where, for a while, they seem content to dwell
at the end of one more aimless étape through the world&mdash;not
in regulation barracks, but in regions too unconventional,
too inconvenient to attract others.</p>
<p>Of this sort was the collection of squatty houses,
forming a &#8220;community,&#8221; where, in the neighbourhood
of other irregulars, Garret Barres dwelt; and into the
lighted entrance of which he now turned, still exhilarated
by his meeting with Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>The architectural agglomeration was known as
Dragon Court&mdash;a faïence Fu-dog above the electric
light over the green entrance door furnishing that priceless
idea&mdash;a Fu-dog now veiled by mesh-wire to provide
against the indiscretions of sparrows lured thither by
housekeeping possibilities lurking among the dense
screens of Japanese ivy covering the façade.</p>
<p>Larry Soane, the irresponsible superintendent, always
turned gardener with April&#8217;s advent in Dragon
Court, contributions from its denizens enabling him to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
pepper a few flower-beds with hyacinths and tulips, and
later with geraniums. These former bulbs had now
gratefully appeared in promising thickets, and Barres
saw the dark form of the handsome, reckless-looking
Irishman fussing over them in the lantern-lit dusk,
while his little daughter, Dulcie, kneeling on the dim
grass, caressed the first blue hyacinth blossom with
thin, childish fingers.</p>
<p>Barres glanced into his letter-box behind the desk,
above which a drop-light threw more shadows than
illumination. Little Dulcie Soane was supposed to sit
under it and emit information, deliver and receive letters,
pay charges on packages, and generally supervise
things when she was not attending school.</p>
<p>There were no letters for the young man. He examined
a package, found it contained his collars from
the laundry, tucked them under his left arm, and
walked to the door looking out upon the dusky interior
court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your garden begins to look very
fine.&#8221; He nodded pleasantly to Dulcie, and the child
responded to his friendly greeting with the tired but
dauntless smile of the young who are missing those
golden years to which all childhood has a claim.</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s three cats came strolling out of the dusk
across the lamplit grass&mdash;a coal black one with sea-green
eyes, known as &#8220;The Prophet,&#8221; and his platonic
mate, white as snow, and with magnificent azure-blue
eyes which, in white cats, usually betokens total deafness.
She was known as &#8220;The Houri&#8221; to the irregulars
of Dragon Court. The third cat, unanimously but misleadingly
christened &#8220;Strindberg&#8221; by the dwellers in
Dragon Court, has already crooked her tortoise-shell
tail and was tearing around in eccentric circles or darting
halfway up trees in a manner characteristic, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
possibly accounting for the name, if not for the sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thim cats of the kid&#8217;s,&#8221; observed Soane, &#8220;do be
scratchin&#8217; up the plants all night long&mdash;bad cess to
thim! Barrin&#8217; thim three omadhauns yonder, I&#8217;d show
ye a purty bed o&#8217; poisies, Misther Barres. But Sthrin&#8217;berg,
God help her, is f&#8217;r diggin&#8217; through to China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie impulsively caressed the Prophet, who turned
his solemn, incandescent eyes on Barres. The Houri
also looked at him, then, intoxicated by the soft spring
evening, rolled lithely upon the new grass and lay there
twitching her snowy tail and challenging the stars out
of eyes that matched their brilliance.</p>
<p>Dulcie got up and walked slowly across the grass to
where Barres stood:</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come to see you this evening?&#8221; she asked,
diffidently, and with a swift, sidelong glance toward
her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, don&#8217;t be worritin&#8217; him!&#8221; grumbled Soane.
&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Misther Barres enough to do, what with all
thim idees he has slitherin&#8217; in his head, an&#8217; all the books
an&#8217; learnin&#8217; an&#8217; picters he has to think of&mdash;whithout
the likes of you at his heels every blessed minute, day
an&#8217; night!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he always lets me&mdash;&#8221; she remonstrated.</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, now, and lave the poor gentleman be! Quit
your futtherin&#8217; an&#8217; muttherin&#8217;. G&#8217;wan in the house, ye
little scut, an&#8217; see what there is f&#8217;r ye to do!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Soane?&#8221; interrupted
Barres good-humouredly. &#8220;Of course she can come up
if she wants to. Do you feel like paying me a visit,
Dulcie, before you go to bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she nodded diffidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come ahead then, Sweetness! And whenever
you want to come you say so. Your father knows well
enough I like to have you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></div>
<p>He smiled at Dulcie; the child&#8217;s shy preference for
his society always had amused him. Besides, she was
always docile and obedient; and she was very sensitive,
too, never outwearing her welcome in his studio, and
always leaving without a murmur when, looking up
from book or drawing he would exclaim cheerfully:
&#8220;Now, Sweetness! Time&#8217;s up! Bed for yours, little
lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been a very gradual acquaintance between
them&mdash;more than two years in developing. From his
first pleasant nod to her when he first came to live in
Dragon Court, it had progressed for a few months,
conservatively on her part, and on his with a detached
but kindly interest born of easy sympathy for youth
and loneliness.</p>
<p>But he had no idea of the passionate response he was
stirring in the motherless, neglected child&mdash;of what
hunger he was carelessly stimulating, what latent qualities
and dormant characteristics he was arousing.</p>
<p>Her appearance, one evening, in her night-dress at
his studio doorway, accompanied by her three cats, began
to enlighten him in regard to her mental starvation.
Tremulous, almost at the point of tears, she had
asked for a book and permission to remain for a few
moments in the studio. He had rung for Selinda, ordered
fruit, cake, and a glass of milk, and had installed
Dulcie upon the sofa with a lapful of books. That
was the beginning.</p>
<p>But Barres still did not entirely understand what
particular magnet drew the child to his studio. The
place was full of beautiful things, books, rugs, pictures,
fine old furniture, cabinets glimmering with porcelains,
ivories, jades, Chinese crystals. These all, in minutest
detail, seemed to fascinate the girl. Yet, after giving
her permission to enter whenever she desired, often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
while reading or absorbed in other affairs, he became
conscious of being watched; and, glancing up, would
frequently surprise her sitting there very silently, with
an open book on her knees, and her strange grey eyes
intently fixed on him.</p>
<p>Then he would always smile and say something
friendly; and usually forget her the next moment in
his absorption of whatever work he had under way.</p>
<p>Only one other man inhabiting Dragon Court ever
took the trouble to notice or speak to the child&mdash;James
Westmore, the sculptor. And he was very friendly in
his vigorous, jolly, rather boisterous way, catching her
up and tossing her about as gaily and irresponsibly as
though she were a rag doll; and always telling her he
was her adopted godfather and would have to chastise
her if she ever deserved it. Also, he was always urging
her to hurry and grow up, because he had a wedding
present for her. And though Dulcie&#8217;s smile was
friendly, and Westmore&#8217;s nonsense pleased the shy
child, she merely submitted, never made any advance.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres&#8217;s ménage was accomplished by two specimens
of mankind, totally opposite in sex and colour;
Selinda, a blonde, slant-eyed, and very trim Finn, doing
duty as maid; and Aristocrates W. Johnson, lately
employed in the capacity of waiter on a dining-car by
the New York Central Railroad&mdash;tall, dignified, graceful,
and Ethiopian&mdash;who cooked as daintily as a débutante
trifling with culinary duty, and served at table
with the languid condescension of a dilettante and
wealthy amateur of domestic arts.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres ascended the two low, easy flights of stairs
and unlocked his door. Aristocrates, setting the table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
in the dining-room, approached gracefully and relieved
his master of hat, coat, and stick.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, a bath and fresh linen keyed
up his already lively spirits; he whistled while he tied
his tie, took a critical look at himself, and, dropping
both hands into the pockets of his dinner jacket, walked
out into the big studio, which also was his living-room.</p>
<p>There was a piano there; he sat down and rattled
off a rollicking air from the most recent spring production,
beginning to realise that he was keyed up for
something livelier than a solitary dinner at home.</p>
<p>His hands fell from the keys and he swung around on
the piano stool and looked into the dining-room rather
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aristocrates!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>The tall pullman butler sauntered gracefully in.</p>
<p>Barres gave him a telephone number to call. Aristocrates
returned presently with the information that
the lady was not at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Try Amsterdam 6703. Ask for Miss
Souval.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Miss Souval, also, was out.</p>
<p>Barres possessed a red-leather covered note-book; he
went to his desk and got it; and under his direction
Aristocrates called up several numbers, reporting adversely
in every case.</p>
<p>It was a fine evening; ladies were abroad or preparing
to fulfil engagements wisely made on such a day
as this had been. And the more numbers he called up
the lonelier the young man began to feel.</p>
<p>Thessalie had not given him either her address or
telephone number. It would have been charming to
have her dine with him. He was now thoroughly inclined
for company. He glanced at the empty dining-room
with aversion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All right; never mind,&#8221; he said, dismissing Aristocrates,
who receded as lithely as though leading a
cake-walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil,&#8221; muttered the young fellow. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to dine here alone. I&#8217;ve had too happy a day
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up restlessly and began to pace the studio.
He knew he could get some man, but he didn&#8217;t want
one. However, it began to look like that or a solitary
dinner.</p>
<p>So after a few more moments&#8217; scowling cogitation
he went out and down the stairs, with the vague idea
of inviting some brother painter&mdash;any one of the regular
irregulars who inhabited Dragon Court.</p>
<p>Dulcie sat behind the little desk near the door, head
bowed, her thin hands clasped over the closed ledger,
and in her pallid face the expressionless dullness of a
child forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Sweetness!&#8221; he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>She looked up; a slight colour tinted her cheeks, and
she smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing? That&#8217;s a very dreary malady&mdash;nothing.
You look lonely. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether you are lonely or not?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I am,&#8221; she ventured, with a shy smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He went out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any letters for me&mdash;or messages?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man&mdash;he had one eye&mdash;came. He asked who you
are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think he was German. He had only one eye. He
asked your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him. Then he went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody who wants to sell artists&#8217; materials,&#8221; he
concluded. Then he looked at the girl: &#8220;So you&#8217;re
lonely, are you? Where are your three cats? Aren&#8217;t
they company for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he said gaily, &#8220;why not give a party
for them? That ought to amuse you, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child still smiled; Barres walked on past her
a pace or two, halted, turned irresolutely, arrived at
some swift decision, and came back, suddenly understanding
that he need seek no further&mdash;that he had
discovered his guest of the evening at his very elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you and your father have your supper, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father went out to eat at Grogan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can find something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not dine with me?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>The child stared, bewildered, then went a little pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we have a dinner party for two&mdash;you and I,
Dulcie? What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing, but her big grey eyes were fixed
on him in a passion of inquiry.</p>
<p>&#8220;A real party,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Let the people get
their own mail and packages until your father returns.
Nobody&#8217;s going to sneak in, anyway. Or, if that won&#8217;t
do, I&#8217;ll call up Grogan&#8217;s and tell your father to come
back because you are going to dine in my studio with
me. Do you know the telephone number? Very well;
get Grogan&#8217;s for me. I&#8217;ll speak to your father.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s hand trembled on the receiver as she called
up Grogan&#8217;s; Barres bent over the transmitter:</p>
<p>&#8220;Soane, Dulcie is going to take dinner in my studio
with me. You&#8217;ll have to come back on duty, when
you&#8217;ve eaten.&#8221; He hung up, looked at Dulcie and
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted company as much as you did,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;Now, go and put on your prettiest frock, and
we&#8217;ll be very grand and magnificent. And afterward
we&#8217;ll talk and look at books and pretty things&mdash;and
maybe we&#8217;ll turn on the Victrola and I&#8217;ll teach you to
dance&mdash;&#8221; He had already begun to ascend the stairs:</p>
<p>&#8220;In half an hour, Dulcie!&#8221; he called back; &#8220;&mdash;and
you may bring the Prophet if you like.... Shall I
ask Mr. Westmore to join us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be all alone with you,&#8221; she said shyly.</p>
<p>He laughed and ran on up the stairs.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In half an hour the electric bell rang very timidly.
Aristocrates, having been instructed and rehearsed,
and, loftily condescending to his rôle in a kindly comedy
to be played seriously, announced: &#8220;Miss Soane!&#8221; in
his most courtly manner.</p>
<p>Barres threw aside the evening paper and came forward,
taking both hands of the white and slightly
frightened child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aristocrates ought to have announced the Prophet,
too,&#8221; he said gaily, breaking the ice and swinging Dulcie
around to face the open door again.</p>
<p>The Prophet entered, perfectly at ease, his eyes of
living jade shining, his tail urbanely hoisted.</p>
<p>Dulcie ventured to smile; Barres laughed outright;
Aristocrates surveyed the Prophet with toleration mingled
with a certain respect. For a black cat is never
without occult significance to a gentleman of colour.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>With Dulcie&#8217;s hand still in his, Barres led her into
the living-room, where, presently, Aristocrates brought
a silver tray upon which was a glass of iced orange
juice for Dulcie, and a &#8220;Bronnix,&#8221; as Aristocrates
called it, for the master.</p>
<p>&#8220;To your health and good fortune in life, Dulcie,&#8221;
he said politely.</p>
<p>The child gazed mutely at him over her glass, then,
blushing, ventured to taste her orange juice.</p>
<p>When she finished, Barres drew her frail arm through
his and took her out, seating her. Ceremonies began
in silence, and the master of the place was not quite
sure whether the flush on Dulcie&#8217;s face indicated unhappy
embarrassment or pleasure.</p>
<p>He need not have worried: the child adored it all.
The Prophet came in and gravely seated himself on a
neighbouring chair, whence he could survey the table
and seriously inspect each course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how grown-up you look with your
bobbed hair put up, and your fluffy gown.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her enchanted eyes to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my first communion dress.... I&#8217;ve had to
make it longer for a graduation dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so; you&#8217;re graduating this summer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221; She sighed unconsciously and sat very
still with folded hands, while Aristocrates refilled her
glass of water.</p>
<p>She no longer felt embarrassed; her gravity matched
Aristocrates&#8217;s; she seriously accepted whatever was offered
or set before her, but Barres noticed that she ate
it all, merely leaving on her plate, with inculcated and
mathematical precision, a small portion as concession
to good manners.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>They had, toward the banquet&#8217;s end, water ices, bon-bons,
French pastry, and ice cream. And presently a
slight and blissful sigh of repletion escaped the child&#8217;s
red lips. The symptoms were satisfactory but unmistakable;
Dulcie was perfectly feminine; her capacity
had proven it.</p>
<p>The Prophet&#8217;s stately self-control in the fragrant
vicinity of nourishment was now to be rewarded: Barres
conducted Dulcie to the studio and installed her among
cushions upon a huge sofa. Then, lighting a cigarette,
he dropped down beside her and crossed one knee over
the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he said in his lazy, humorous way, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
funny old world any way you view it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it is always funny?&#8221; inquired the
child, her deep, grey eyes on his face.</p>
<p>He smiled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do; but sometimes the joke in on one&#8217;s self.
And then, although it is still a funny world, from the
world&#8217;s point of view, you, of course, fail to see the
humour of it.... I don&#8217;t suppose you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; nodded the child, with the ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Well, I was afraid I&#8217;d been talking nonsense,
but if you understand, it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to look at some books?&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather listen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll begin at this corner of the room and
tell you about the things in it.&#8221; And for a while he
rambled lazily on about old French chairs and Spanish
chests, and the panels of Mille Fleur tapestry which
hung behind them; the two lovely pre-Raphael panels
in their exquisite ancient frames; the old Venetian velvet
covering triple choir-stalls in the corner; the ivory-toned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
marble figure on its wood and compos pedestal,
where tendrils and delicate foliations of water gilt had
become slightly irridescent, harmonising with the patine
on the ancient Chinese garniture flanking a mantel clock
of dullest gold.</p>
<p>About these things, their workmanship, the histories
of their times, he told her in his easy, unaccented voice,
glancing sideways at her from time to time to note how
she stood it.</p>
<p>But she listened, fascinated, her gaze moving from
the object discussed to the man who discussed it; her
slim limbs curled under her, her hands clasped around
a silken cushion made from the robe of some Chinese
princess.</p>
<p>Lounging there beside her, amused, humorously flattered
by her attention, and perhaps a little touched,
he held forth a little longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a nice party, so far, Dulcie?&#8221; he concluded
with a smile.</p>
<p>She flushed, found no words, nodded, and sat with
lowered head as though pondering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you rather do if you could do what
you want to in the world, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;Live with you,&#8221; she said seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dulcie! That is no sort of ambition for a
growing girl!&#8221; he laughed; and she laughed, too, watching
his every expression out of grey eyes that were her
chiefest beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a little too young to know what you want
yet,&#8221; he concluded, still smiling. &#8220;By the time that
bobbed mop of red hair grows to a proper length, you&#8217;ll
know more about yourself.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it up?&#8221; she enquired naïvely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes you look older.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want it to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; he nodded, noticing the snowy neck
which the new coiffure revealed. It was becoming evident
to him that Dulcie had her own vanities&mdash;little
pathetic vanities which touched him as he glanced at
the reconstructed first communion dress and the drooping
hyacinth pinned at the waist, and the cheap white
slippers on a foot as slenderly constructed as her long
and narrow hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your mother die long ago, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like her, I fancy&mdash;&#8221; thinking of Soane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres had heard Soane hold forth in his cups on
one or two occasions&mdash;nothing more than the vague
garrulousness of a Celt made more loquacious by the
whiskey of one Grogan&mdash;something about his having
been a gamekeeper in his youth, and that his wife&mdash;&#8220;God
rest her!&#8221;&mdash;might have held up her head with
&#8220;anny wan o&#8217; thim in th&#8217; Big House.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recollecting this, he idly wondered what the story
might have been&mdash;a young girl&#8217;s perverse infatuation
for her father&#8217;s gamekeeper, perhaps&mdash;a handsome,
common, ignorant youth, reckless and irresponsible
enough to take advantage of her&mdash;probably some such
story&mdash;resembling similar histories of chauffeurs, riding-masters,
grooms, and coachmen at home.</p>
<p>The Prophet came noiselessly into the studio,
stopped at sight of his little mistress, twitched his tail
reflectively, then leaped onto a carved table and calmly
began his ablutions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>Barres got up and wound up the Victrola. Then
he kicked aside a rug or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is to be a real party, you know,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t dance, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said diffidently, &#8220;a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Dulcie got off the sofa, shook out her reconstructed
gown. When he came over to where she stood, she
laid her hand in his almost solemnly, so overpowering
had become the heavenly sequence of events. For the
rite of his hospitality had indeed become a rite to her.
Never before had she stood in awe, enthralled before
such an altar as this man&#8217;s hearthstone. Never had
she dreamed that he who so wondrously served it could
look at such an offering as hers&mdash;herself.</p>
<p>But the miracle had happened; altar and priest were
accepting her; she laid her hand, which trembled, in
his; gave herself to his guidance and to the celestial
music, scarcely seeing, scarcely hearing his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dance delightfully,&#8221; he was saying; &#8220;you&#8217;re a
born dancer, Dulcie. I do it fairly well myself, and I
ought to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was really very much surprised. He was enjoying
it immensely. When the Victrola gave up the
ghost he wound it again and came back to resume.
Under his suggestions and tutelage, they tried more
intricate steps, devious and ambitious, and Dulcie, unterrified
by terpsichorean complications, surmounted
every one with his whispered coaching and expert aid.</p>
<p>Now it came to a point where time was not for him.
He was too interested, enjoying it too genuinely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when they paused to enable him to resurrect
the defunct music in the Victrola, they laughed at
the Prophet, who sat upon the ancient carved table,
gravely surveying them. Sometimes they rested because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
he thought she ought to&mdash;himself a trifle pumped&mdash;only
to find, to his amazement, that he need not be
solicitous concerning her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>A tall and ancient clock ringing midnight from clear,
uncompromising bells, brought Barres to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;this won&#8217;t do! Dear
child, I&#8217;m having a wonderful time, but I&#8217;ve got to deliver
you to your father!&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her arm through his, laughingly pretending
horror and haste; she fled lightly along beside him as
he whisked her through the hall and down the stairs.</p>
<p>A candle burned on the desk. Soane sat there,
asleep, and odorous of alcohol, his flushed face buried
in his arms.</p>
<p>But Soane was what is known as a &#8220;sob-souse&#8221;;
never ugly in his cups, merely inclined to weep over
the immemorial wrongs of Ireland.</p>
<p>He woke up when Barres touched his shoulder,
rubbed his swollen eyes and black, curly head, gazed
tragically at his daughter:</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan to bed, ye little scut!&#8221; he said, getting to his
feet with a terrific yawn.</p>
<p>Barres took her hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a wonderful party, haven&#8217;t we, Sweetness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; whispered the child.</p>
<p>The next instant she was gone like a ghost, through
the dusky, whitewashed corridor where distorted shadows
trembled in the candlelight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soane,&#8221; said Barres, &#8220;this won&#8217;t do, you know.
They&#8217;ll sack you if you keep on drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, not yet forty, a battered, middle-aged by-product
of hale and reckless vigour, passed his hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
over his temples with the dignity of a Hibernian Hamlet:</p>
<p>&#8220;The harp that wanst through Tara&#8217;s halls&mdash;&#8221; he
began; but memory failed; and two tears&mdash;by-products,
also, of Grogan&#8217;s whiskey&mdash;sparkled in his reproachful
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m merely telling you,&#8221; remarked Barres. &#8220;We
all like you, Soane, but the landlord won&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May God forgive him,&#8221; muttered Soane. &#8220;Was
there ever a landlord but he was a tyrant, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres blew out the candle; a faint light above the
Fu-dog outside, over the street door, illuminated the
stone hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to keep sober for your little daughter&#8217;s
sake,&#8221; insisted Barres in a low voice. &#8220;You love her,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do that!&#8221; said Soane&mdash;&#8220;God bless her and her
poor mother, who could hould up her pretty head with
anny wan till she tuk up with th&#8217; like o&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>
<p>His brogue always increased in his cups; devotion
to Ireland and a lofty scorn of landlords grew with
both.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep away from Grogan&#8217;s,&#8221; remarked
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a bite an&#8217; a sup at Grogan&#8217;s. Is there anny
harrm in that, sorr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the &#8216;sup,&#8217; Larry. Cut out that gang of
bums at Grogan&#8217;s, too. There are too many Germans
hanging out around Grogan&#8217;s these days. You Sinn
Feiners or Clan-na-Gael, or whatever you are, had better
manage your own affairs, anyway. The old-time
Feinans stood on their own sturdy legs, not on German
beer-skids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisha then, sorr, d&#8217;ye mind th&#8217; ould song they sang
in thim days:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></div>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Then up steps Bonyparty</i></p>
<p><i>An&#8217; takes me by the hand,</i></p>
<p><i>And how is ould Ireland,</i></p>
<p><i>And how does she shtand?</i></p>
<p><i>It&#8217;s a poor, disthressed country</i></p>
<p><i>As ever yet was seen,</i></p>
<p><i>And they&#8217;re hangin&#8217; men and women</i></p>
<p><i>For the wearing of the green!</i></p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><i>Oh, the wearing of the</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Barres drily. &#8220;Do you want to
wake the house? Don&#8217;t go to Grogan&#8217;s and talk about
Ireland to any Germans. I&#8217;ll tell you why: we&#8217;ll probably
be at war with Germany ourselves within a year,
and that&#8217;s a pretty good reason for you Irish to keep
clear of all Germans. Go to bed!&#8221;</p>

<h2>VI
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />DULCIE</span></h2>
</div>
<p>One warm afternoon late in spring, Dulcie Soane,
returning from school to Dragon Court, found
her father behind the desk, as usual, awaiting
his daughter&#8217;s advent, to release him from duty.</p>
<p>A tall, bony man with hectic and sunken cheeks and
only a single eye was standing by the desk, earnestly
engaged in whispered conversation with her father.</p>
<p>He drew aside instantly as Dulcie came up and laid
her school books on the desk. Soane, already redolent
of Grogan&#8217;s whiskey, pushed back his chair and got to
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan in f&#8217;r a bite an&#8217; a sup,&#8221; he said to his daughter,
&#8220;while I talk to the gintleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Dulcie went slowly into the superintendent&#8217;s dingy
quarters for her mid-day meal, which was dinner; and
between her and a sloppy scrub-woman who cooked for
them, she managed to warm up and eat what Soane had
left for her from his own meal.</p>
<p>When she returned to the desk in the hall, the one-eyed
man had gone. Soane sat on the chair behind
the desk, his face over-red and shiny, his heels drumming
the devil&#8217;s tattoo on the tessellated pavement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be at Grogan&#8217;s,&#8221; he said, as Dulcie seated herself
in the ancient leather chair behind the desk telephone,
and began to sort the pile of mail which the
postman evidently had just delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she murmured absently, turning around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
and beginning to distribute the letters and parcels in
the various numbered compartments behind her. Soane
slid off his chair to his feet and straightened up,
stretching and yawning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Av anny wan tilliphones to Misther Barres,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;listen in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen in, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you. And if it&#8217;s a lady, ask
her name first, and then listen in. And if she says her
name is Quellen or Dunois, mind what she says to
Misther Barres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; enquired Dulcie, astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Becuz I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not do that,&#8221; said the girl, flushing up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, bother! Sure, there&#8217;s no harm in it, Dulcie!
Would I be askin&#8217; ye to do wrong, asthore? Me who
is your own blood and kin? Listen then: &#8217;Tis a woman
what do be botherin&#8217; the poor young gentleman, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll not have him f&#8217;r to be put upon. Listen, m&#8217;acushla,
and if airy a lady tilliphones, or if she comes futtherin&#8217;
an&#8217; muttherin&#8217; around here, call me at Grogan&#8217;s and
I&#8217;ll be soon dishposen&#8217; av the likes av her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she ever been here&mdash;this lady?&#8221; asked the girl,
uncertain and painfully perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure has she! Manny&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve chased her
out,&#8221; replied Soane glibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. What does she look like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows&mdash;annything ye don&#8217;t wish f&#8217;r to look
like yourself! Sure, I disremember what make of
woman she might be&mdash;her name&#8217;s enough for you. Call
me up if she comes or rings. She may be a dangerous
woman, at that,&#8221; he added, &#8220;so speak fair to her and
listen in to what she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie slowly nodded, looking at him hard.</p>
<p>Soane put on his faded brown hat at an angle, fished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
a cigar with a red and gold band from his fancy but
soiled waistcoat, scratched a match on the seat of his
greasy pants, and sauntered out through the big, whitewashed
hallway into the street, with a touch of the
swagger which always characterised him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dulcie, both hands buried in her ruddy hair and both
thin elbows on the desk, sat poring over her school
books.</p>
<p>Graduation day was approaching; there was much
for her to absorb, much to memorise before then.</p>
<p>As she studied she hummed to herself the air of the
quaint song which she was to sing at her graduation
exercises. That did not interfere with her concentration;
but as she finished one lesson, cast aside the book,
and opened another to prepare the next lesson, vaguely
happy memories of her evening party with Barres came
into her mind to disturb her thoughts, tempting her
to reverie and the delicious idleness she knew only when
alone and absorbed in thoughts of him.</p>
<p>But she resolutely put him out of her mind and
opened her book.</p>
<p>The hall clock ticked loudly through the silence;
slanting sun rays fell through the street grille, across
the tessellated floor where flies crawled and buzzed.</p>
<p>The Prophet sat full in a bar of sunlight and gravely
followed the movements of the flies as though specialising
on the study of those amazing insects.</p>
<p>Tenants of Dragon Court passed out or entered at
intervals, pausing to glance at their letter-boxes or requesting
their keys.</p>
<p>Westmore came down the eastern staircase, like an
avalanche, with a cheery:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Dulcie! Any letters? All right, old dear!
If you see Mr. Mandel, tell him I&#8217;ll be at the club!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>Corot Mandel came in presently, and she gave him
Westmore&#8217;s message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said, not even glancing at the thin
figure in the shabby dress too small for her. And, after
peering into his letter-box, he went away with the indolent
swing of a large and powerful plantigrade, gazing
fixedly ahead of him out of heavy, oriental eyes,
and twisting up his jet black, waxed moustache.</p>
<p>A tall, handsome girl called and enquired for Mr.
Trenor. Dulcie returned her amiable smile, unhooked
the receiver, and telephoned up. But nobody answered
from Esmé Trenor&#8217;s apartment, and the girl, whose
name was Damaris Souval, and whose profession varied
between the stage and desultory sitting for artists,
smiled once more on Dulcie and sauntered out in her
very charming summer gown.</p>
<p>The shabby child looked after her through the sunny
hallway, the smile still curving her lips&mdash;a sensitive,
winning smile, untainted by envy. Then she resumed
her book, serenely clearing her youthful mind of vanity
and desire for earthly things.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Esmé Trenor sauntered in. His
was a <ins title='Was sensative'>sensitive</ins> nature and fastidious, too. Dinginess,
obscurity&mdash;everything that was shabby, tarnished,
humble in life, he consistently ignored. He had ignored
Dulcie Soane for three years: he ignored her now.</p>
<p>He glanced indifferently into his letter-box as he
passed the desk. Dulcie said, with the effort it always
required for her to speak to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Souval called, but left no message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trenor&#8217;s supercilious glance rested on her for the
fraction of a second, then, with a bored nod, he continued
on his way and up the stairs. And Dulcie returned
to her book.</p>
<p>The desk telephone rang: a Mrs. Helmund desired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
to speak to Mr. Trenor. Dulcie switched her on, rested
her chin on her hand, and continued her reading.</p>
<p>Some time afterward the telephone rang again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dragon Court,&#8221; said Dulcie, mechanically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to speak to Mr. Barres, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barres has not come in from luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; <ins title='Was same'>said</ins> the pretty, feminine voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite sure,&#8221; replied Dulcie. &#8220;Wait a minute&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She called Barres&#8217;s apartment; Aristocrates answered
and confirmed his master&#8217;s absence with courtly
effusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he is not in,&#8221; repeated Dulcie. &#8220;Who shall I
say called him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say that Miss Dunois called him up. If he comes
in, say that Miss Thessalie Dunois will come at five to
take tea with him. Thank you. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startled to hear the very name against which her
father had warned her, Dulcie found it difficult to reconcile
the sweet voice that came to her over the wire
with the voice of any such person her father had described.</p>
<p>Still a trifle startled, she laid aside the receiver with
a disturbed glance toward the wrought-iron door at the
further end of the hall.</p>
<p>She had no desire at all to call up her father at
Grogan&#8217;s and inform him of what had occurred. The
mere thought of surreptitious listening in, of eavesdropping,
of informing, reddened her face. Also, she
had long since lost confidence in the somewhat battered
but jaunty man who had always neglected her, although
never otherwise unkind, even when intoxicated.</p>
<p>No, she would neither listen in nor inform on anybody
at the behest of a father for whom, alas, she had
no respect, merely those shreds of conventional feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
which might once have been filial affection, but had
become merely an habitual solicitude.</p>
<p>No, her character, her nature refused such obedience.
If there was trouble between the owner of the
unusually sweet voice and Mr. Barres, it was their affair,
not hers, not her father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This settled in her mind, she opened another book
and turned the pages slowly until she came to the lesson
to be learned.</p>
<p>It was hard to concentrate; her thoughts were straying,
now, to Barres.</p>
<p>And, as she leaned there, musing above her dingy
school book, through the grilled door at the further
end of the hall stepped a young girl in a light summer
gown&mdash;a beautiful girl, lithe, graceful, exquisitely
groomed&mdash;who came swiftly up to the desk, a trifle pale
and breathless:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barres? He lives here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please announce Miss Dunois.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie flushed deeply under the shock:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr.&mdash;Mr. Barres is still out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Was it you I talked to over the telephone?&#8221;
asked Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Barres has not <ins title='Was reutrned'>returned</ins>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie bit her lip, hesitated, turned to go. And
at the same instant Dulcie saw the one-eyed man at the
street door, peering through the iron grille.</p>
<p>Thessalie saw him, too, stiffened to marble, stood
staring straight at him.</p>
<p>He turned and went away up the street. But Dulcie,
to whom the incident signified nothing in particular except
the impudence of a one-eyed man, was not prepared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
for the face which Thessalie Dunois turned toward her.
Not a vestige of colour remained in it, and her dark
eyes seemed feverish and too large.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not give Mr. Barres any message from
me,&#8221; she said in an altered voice, which sounded strained
and unsteady. &#8220;Please do not even say that I came
or mention my name.... May I ask it of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie, very silent in her surprise, made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please may I ask it of you?&#8221; whispered Thessalie.
&#8220;Do you mind not telling anybody that I was here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If&mdash;you wish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. May I trust you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;&#8221; A bank bill was in her gloved fingers;
intuition warned her; she took another swift look
at Dulcie. The child&#8217;s face was flaming scarlet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; whispered Thessalie.... &#8220;And
thank you, dear&mdash;&#8221; She bent over quickly, took Dulcie&#8217;s
hand, pressed it, looking her in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I am not asking
you to do anything you shouldn&#8217;t. Mr. Barres will
understand it all when I write to him.... Did you
see that man at the street door, looking through the
grating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who he is?&#8221; whispered Thessalie.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never before seen him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was here at two o&#8217;clock talking to my
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s name is Lawrence Soane. He is superintendent
of Dragon Court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie Soane.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>Thessalie still held her hand tightly. Then with a
quick but forced smile, she pressed it, thanking the girl
for her consideration, turned and walked swiftly
through the hall out into the street.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dulcie, dreaming over her closed books in the fading
light, vaguely uneasy lest her silence might embrace
the faintest shadow of disloyalty to Barres,
looked up quickly at the sound of his familiar footsteps
on the pavement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, little comrade,&#8221; he called to her on his way
to the stairs. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t we have a jolly party the other
evening? I&#8217;m going out to another party this evening,
but I bet it won&#8217;t be as jolly as ours!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any letters, Sweetness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None, Mr. Barres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the better. I have too many letters, too many
visitors. It leaves me no time to have another party
with you. But we shall have another, Dulcie&mdash;never
fear. That is,&#8221; he added, pretending to doubt her
receptiveness of his invitation, &#8220;if you would care to
have another with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She merely looked at him, smiling deliciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a good child and we&#8217;ll have another!&#8221; he called
back to her, running on up the western staircase.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Around seven o&#8217;clock her father came in, steady
enough of foot but shiny-red in the face and maudlin
drunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;That woman was here,&#8221; he whined, &#8220;an&#8217; ye never
called me up! I am b-bethrayed be me childer&mdash;wurra
the day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, father! If any one sees you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; phwy not! Am I ashamed o&#8217; the tears I shed?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
No, I am not. No Irishman need take shame along av
the tears he sheds for Ireland&mdash;God bless her where
she shtands!&mdash;wid the hob-nails av the crool tyrant
foreninst her bleeding neck an&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That woman I warned ye of! She was here! &#8217;Twas
the wan-eyed lad who seen her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie rose and took him by his arm. He made no
resistance; but he wept while she conducted him bedward,
as the immemorial wrongs of Ireland tore his
soul.</p>

<h2>VII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The tremendous tragedy in Europe, now nearing
the end of the second act, had been slowly shaking
the drowsy Western World out of its snug
slumber of complacency. Young America was already
sitting up in bed, awake, alert, listening. Older America,
more difficult to convince, rolled solemn and interrogative
eyes toward Washington, where the wooden
gods still sat nodding in a row, smiling vacuously at
destiny out of carved and painted features. Eyes had
they but they saw not, ears but they heard not; neither
spake they through their mouths.</p>
<p>Yet, they that made them were no longer like unto
them, for many an anxious idolater no longer trusted
in them. For their old God&#8217;s voice was sounding in
their ears.</p>
<p>The voice of a great ex-president, too, had been
thundering from the wilderness; lesser prophets, endowed,
however, with intellect and vision, had been
warning the young West that the second advent of
Attila was at hand; an officer of the army, inspired
of God, had preached preparedness from the market
places and had established for its few disciples an habitation;
and a great Admiral had died of a broken
heart because his lips had been officially sealed&mdash;the
wisest lips that ever told of those who go down to the
sea in ships.</p>
<p>Plainer and plainer in American ears sounded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
mounting surf of that blood-red sea thundering against
the frontiers of Democracy; clearer and clearer came
the discordant clamour of the barbaric hordes; louder
and more menacing the half-crazed blasphemies of
their chief, who had given the very name of the Scourge
of God to one among the degenerate litter he had sired.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Garret Barres had been educated like any American
of modern New York type. Harvard, then five years
abroad, and a return to his native city revealed him
as an ambitious, receptive, intelligent young man,
deeply interested in himself and his own affairs, theoretically
patriotic, a good citizen by intention, an affectionate
son and brother, and already a pretty good
painter of the saner species.</p>
<p>A modest income of his own enabled him to bide his
time and decline pot-boilers. A comparatively young
father and an even more youthful mother, both of
sporting proclivities, together with a sister of the same
tastes, were his preferred companions when he had
time to go home to the family rooftree in northern
New York. His lines, indeed, were cast in pleasant
places. Beside still waters in green pastures, he could
always restore his city-tarnished soul when he desired
to retire for a while from the battleground of endeavour.</p>
<p>The city, after all, offered him a world-wide battlefield;
for Garret Barres was by choice a painter of
thoroughbred women, of cosmopolitan men&mdash;a younger
warrior of the brush imbued with the old traditions
of those great English captains of portraiture, who
recorded for us the more brilliant human truths of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>
<p>From their stately canvases aglow, the eyes of the
lovely dead look out at us; the eyes of ambition, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
pride, of fatuous complacency; the haunted eyes of
sorrow; the clear eyes of faith. Out of the past they
gaze&mdash;those who once lived&mdash;deathlessly recorded by
Van Dyck, Lely, Kneller; by Gainsborough, Reynolds,
Hoppner, Lawrence, Raeburn; or consigned to a dignified
destiny by Stuart, Sully, Inman, and Vanderlyn.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Barres returned to New York after many
years, he found that the aspect of the city had not
altered very greatly. The usual dirt, disorder, and
municipal confusion still reigned; subways were being
dug, but since the memory of man runneth, the streets
of the metropolis have been dug up, and its market
places and byways have been an abomination.</p>
<p>The only visible excitement, however, was in the war
columns of the newspapers, and, sometimes, around
bulletin boards where wrangling groups were no uncommon
sight, citizens and aliens often coming into verbal
collision&mdash;sometimes physical&mdash;promptly suppressed
by bored policemen.</p>
<p>There was a &#8220;preparedness&#8221; parade; thousands of
worthy citizens marched in it, nervously aware, now,
that the Great Republic&#8217;s only mobile military division
was on the Mexican border, where also certain Guard
regiments were likely to be directed to reinforce the
regulars&mdash;pet regiments from the city, among whose
corps of officers and enlisted men everybody had some
friend or relative.</p>
<p>But these regiments had not yet entrained. There
were few soldiers to be seen on the streets. Khaki
began to be noticeable in New York only when the
Plattsburg camps opened. After that there was an interim
of the usual dull, unaccented civilian monotony,
mitigated at rare intervals by this dun-coloured ebb
and flow from Plattsburg.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>Like the first vague premonitions of a nightmare the
first ominous symptoms of depression were slowly possessing
hearts already uneasy under two years&#8217; burden
of rumours unprintable, horrors incredible to those
aloof and pursuing the peaceful tenor of their ways.</p>
<p>A growing restlessness, unbelief, the incapacity to
understand&mdash;selfishness, rapacity, self-righteousness,
complacency, cowardice, even stupidity itself were
being jolted and shocked into something resembling a
glimmer of comprehension as the hunnish U-boats, made
ravenous by the taste of blood, steered into western
shipping lanes like a vast shoal of sharks.</p>
<p>And always thicker and thicker came the damning
tales of rape and murder, of cowardly savagery, brutal
vileness, degenerate bestiality&mdash;clearer, nearer, distinctly
audible, the sigh of a ravaged and expiring
civilisation trampled to obliteration by the slavering,
ferocious swine of the north.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Fires among shipping, fires amid great stores of
cotton and grain destined for France or England, explosions
of munitions of war ordered by nations of the
Entente, the clumsy propaganda or impudent sneers
of German and pro-German newspapers; reports of
German meddling in Mexico, in South America, in
Japan; more sinister news concerning the insolent activities
of certain embassies&mdash;all these were beginning
to have their logical effect among a fat and prosperous
people which simply could not bear to be aroused
from pleasant dreams of brotherhood to face the raw
and hellish truth.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;For fifty years,&#8221; remarked Barres to his neighbour,
Esmé Trenor, also a painter of somewhat eccentric
portraits, &#8220;our national characteristic has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
a capacity for absorbing bunk and a fixed determination
to kid ourselves. There really is a war, Trenor, old
top, and we&#8217;re going to get into it before very long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trenor, a tall, tired, exquisitely groomed young man,
who once had painted a superficially attractive portrait
of a popular débutante, and had been overwhelmed
with fashionable orders ever since, was the adored of
women. He dropped one attenuated knee over the
other and lighted an attenuated cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy anybody bothering enough about anything
to fight over it!&#8221; he said languidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to <i>war</i>, Trenor,&#8221; repeated Barres,
jamming his brushes into a bowl of black soap. &#8220;That&#8217;s
my positive conviction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours is so disturbingly positive a nature,&#8221; remonstrated
the other. &#8220;Why ever raise a row? Nothing
positive is of any real importance&mdash;not even opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, vigorously cleaning his brushes in turpentine
and black soap, glanced around at Trenor, and in
his quick smile there glimmered a hint of good-natured
malice. For Esmé Trenor was notoriously anything
except positive in his painting, always enveloping a
lack of technical knowledge with a veil of camouflage.
Behind this pretty veil hid many defects, perhaps even
deformities&mdash;protected by vague, indefinite shadows
and the effrontery of an adroit exploiter of the restless
sex.</p>
<p>But Esmé Trenor was both clever and alert. He
had not even missed that slight and momentary glimmer
of good-humoured malice in the pleasant glance of
Barres. But, like his more intelligent prototype,
Whistler, it was impossible to know whether or not
discovery ever made any particular difference to him.
He tucked a lilac-bordered handkerchief a little deeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
into his cuff, glanced at his jewelled wrist-watch, shook
the long ash from his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be positive in anything,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;is an
effort; effort entails exertion; exertion is merely a degree
of violence; violence engenders toxins; toxins dull
the intellect. Quod erat, dear friend. You see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I see,&#8221; nodded Barres, always frankly
amused at Trenor and his ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, if you see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Trenor waved a long,
bony, over-manicured hand, expelled a ring or two of
smoke, meditatively; then, in his characteristically languid
voice: &#8220;To be positive closes the door to further
observation and pulls down the window shades.
Nothing remains except to go to bed. Is there anything
more uninteresting than to go to bed? Is there
anything more depressing than to know all about something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do converse like an ass sometimes,&#8221; remarked
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;sometimes. Not now, Barres. I don&#8217;t desire
to know all about anybody or anything. Fancy my
knowing all about art, for example!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, fancy!&#8221; repeated Barres, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or about anything specific&mdash;a woman, for example!&#8221;
He shrugged wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you meet a woman and like her, don&#8217;t you want
to know all there is to know about her?&#8221; inquired
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; returned the other with languid
contempt. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to know anything at all about
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we differ about that, old top.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Religiously. A woman can be only an incidental
amusement in one&#8217;s career. You don&#8217;t go to a musical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
comedy twice, do you? And any woman will reveal
herself sufficiently in one evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice, kindly domestic instincts you have, Trenor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m merely fastidious,&#8221; returned the other, dropping
his cigarette out of the open window. He rose,
yawned, took his hat, stick and gloves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye,&#8221; he said languidly. &#8220;I&#8217;m painting Elsena
Helmund this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres said, with good-humoured envy:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve neither commission nor sitter. If I had, you
bet I&#8217;d not stand there yawning at my luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is you who have the luck, not I,&#8221; drawled Trenor.
&#8220;I give a portion of my spiritual and material self
with every brush stroke, while you remain at liberty to
flourish and grow fat in idleness. I perish as I create;
my life exhausts itself to feed my art. What you
call my good luck is my martyrdom. You see, dear
friend, how fortunate you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; grinned Barres. &#8220;But will your spiritual
nature stand such a cruel drain? Aren&#8217;t you afraid
your morality may totter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morality,&#8221; mused Esmé, going; &#8220;that is one of
those early Gothic terms now obsolete, I believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He sauntered out with his hat and gloves and stick,
still murmuring:</p>
<p>&#8220;Morality? Gothic&mdash;very Gothic&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, still amused, sorted his wet brushes, dried
them carefully one by one on a handful of cotton waste,
and laid them in a neat row across the soapstone top
of his palette-table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; he muttered cheerfully. &#8220;I could paint
like a streak this morning if I had the chance&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw himself back in his chair and sat there
smoking for a while, his narrowing eyes fixed on a great
window which opened above the court. Soft spring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
breezes stirred the curtains; sparrows were noisy out
there; a strip of cobalt sky smiled at him over the opposite
chimneys; an April cloud floated across it.</p>
<p>He rose, walked over to the window and glanced
down into the court. Several more hyacinths were now
in blossom. The Prophet dozed majestically, curled
up on an Italian garden seat. Beside him sprawled
the snow white Houri, stretched out full length in the
sun, her wonderful blue eyes following the irrational
gambols of the tortoise-shell cat, Strindberg, who had
gone loco, as usual, and was tearing up and down trees,
prancing sideways with flattened ears and crooked tail,
in terror at things invisible, or digging furiously toward
China amid the hyacinths.</p>
<p>Dulcie Soane came out into the court presently
and expostulated with Strindberg, who suffered herself
to be removed from the hyacinth bed, only to make
a hysterical charge on her mistress&#8217;s ankles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it, you crazy thing!&#8221; insisted Dulcie, administering
a gentle slap which sent the cat bucketing and
corvetting across the lawn, where the eccentric course
of a dead leaf, blown by the April wind, instantly occupied
its entire intellectual vacuum.</p>
<p>Barres, leaning on the window-sill, said, without raising
his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Dulcie! How are you, after our party?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child looked up, smiled shyly her response
through the pale glory of the April sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing to-day?&#8221; he inquired, with
casual but friendly interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. Well, if you&#8217;re doing nothing you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
just as busy as I am,&#8221; he remarked, smiling down at
her where she stood below his window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you paint pictures?&#8221; ventured the girl
diffidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I haven&#8217;t any orders. Isn&#8217;t that sad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.... But you could paint a picture just to
please yourself, couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anybody to paint from,&#8221; he explained with
amiable indifference, lazily watching the effect of alternate
shadow and sunlight on her upturned face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you find&mdash;somebody?&#8221; Her heart had
suddenly begun to beat very fast.</p>
<p>Barres laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to have your portrait painted?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could scarcely find voice to reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you&mdash;let me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The slim young figure down there in the April sunshine
had now arrested his professional attention. With
detached interest he inspected her for a few moments;
then:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d make an interesting study, Dulcie. What do
you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;do you mean that you <i>want</i> me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes! Would you like to pose for me? It&#8217;s
pin-money, anyway. Would you like to try it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure? It&#8217;s hard work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite&mdash;sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she stammered. The little flushed
face was lifted very earnestly to his now, almost beseechingly.
&#8220;I am quite sure,&#8221; she repeated breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;d really like to pose for me?&#8221; he insisted in
smiling surprise at the girl&#8217;s visible excitement. Then
he added abruptly: &#8220;I&#8217;ve half a mind to give you a
job as my private model!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>Through the rosy confusion of her face her grey
eyes were fixed on him with a wistful intensity, almost
painful. For into her empty heart and starved mind
had suddenly flashed a dazzling revelation. Opportunity
was knocking at her door. Her chance had
come! Perhaps it had been inherited from her mother&mdash;God
knows!&mdash;this deep, deep hunger for things beautiful&mdash;this
passionate longing for light and knowledge.</p>
<p>Mere contact with such a man as Barres had already
made endurable a solitary servitude which had
been subtly destroying her child&#8217;s spirit, and slowly
dulling the hunger in her famished mind. And now
to aid him&mdash;to feel that he was using her&mdash;was to arise
from her rags of ignorance and emerge upright into
the light which filled that wonder-house wherein he
dwelt, and on the dark threshold of which her lonely
little soul had crouched so long in silence.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She looked up almost blindly at the man who, in
careless friendliness, had already opened his door to
her, had permitted her to read his wonder-books, had
allowed her to sit unreproved and silent from sheer
happiness, and gaze unsatiated upon the wondrous
things within the magic mansion where he dwelt.</p>
<p>And now to serve this man; to aid him, to creep
into the light in which he stood and strive to learn
and see!&mdash;the thought already had produced a delicate
intoxication in the child, and she gazed up at
Barres from the sunny garden with her naked soul in
her eyes. Which confused, perplexed, and embarrassed
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on up,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell your father
over the &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She entered without a sound, closed the door which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
he had left open for her, advanced across the thick-meshed
rug. She still wore her blue gingham apron;
her bobbed hair, full of ruddy lights, intensified the
whiteness of her throat. In her arms she cradled the
Prophet, who stared solemnly at Barres out of depthless
green eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; thought Barres to himself, &#8220;I believe
I have found a model and an uncommon one!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie, watching his expression, smiled slightly and
stroked the Prophet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll paint you that way! Don&#8217;t stir,&#8221; said the
young fellow pleasantly. &#8220;Just stand where you are,
Dulcie. You&#8217;re quite all right as you are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
lifted a half-length canvas, placed it on his heavy easel
and clamped it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel exactly like painting,&#8221; he continued, busy
with his brushes and colours. &#8220;I&#8217;m full of it to-day.
It&#8217;s in me. It&#8217;s got to come out.... And you certainly
are an interesting subject&mdash;with your big grey
eyes and bobbed red hair&mdash;oh, quite interesting constructively,
too&mdash;as well as from the colour point.&#8221;</p>
<p>He finished setting his palette, gathered up a handful
of brushes:</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bother to draw you except with a
brush&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked across at her, remained looking, the pleasantly
detached expression of his features gradually
changing to curiosity, to the severity of increasing interest,
to concentrated and silent absorption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he presently concluded, &#8220;you are so unusually
interesting and paintable that you make me
think very seriously.... And I&#8217;m hanged if I&#8217;m going
to waste you by slapping a technically adequate
sketch of you onto this nice new canvas ... which
might give me pleasure while I&#8217;m doing it ... and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
might even tickle my vanity for a week ... and then
be laid away to gather dust ... and be covered over
next year and used for another sketch.... No....
<i>No</i>!... You&#8217;re worth more than that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to pace the place to and fro, thinking very
hard, glancing around at her from moment to moment,
where she stood, obediently immovable on the
blue meshed rug, clasping the Prophet to her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to become my private model?&#8221; he demanded
abruptly. &#8220;I mean seriously. Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean a real model, from whom I can ask anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, please,&#8221; pleaded the girl, trembling a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand what it means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you&#8217;ll be required to wear few clothes.
Sometimes none. Did you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Mr. Westmore asked me once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t care to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind doing it for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you ask me,&#8221; she said, trying to
smile and shivering with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. It&#8217;s a bargain. You&#8217;re my model, Dulcie.
When do you graduate from school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In June.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months! Well&mdash;all right. Until then it will
be a half day through the week, and all day Saturdays
and Sundays, if I require you. You&#8217;ll have a weekly
salary&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He smiled and mentioned the figure, and
the girl blushed vividly. She had, it appeared, expected
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dulcie!&#8221; he exclaimed, immensely amused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t intend to come here and give me all your
time for nothing, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why on earth should you do such a thing for
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She found no words to explain why.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;you&#8217;re a business woman
now. Your father will have to find somebody to cook
for him and take the desk when he&#8217;s out at Grogan&#8217;s.
Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll fix it with him.... By the way,
Dulcie, supposing you sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>She found a chair and took the Prophet onto her
lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, this will be very convenient for me,&#8221; he went
on, inspecting her with increasing satisfaction. &#8220;If
I ever have any orders&mdash;any sitters&mdash;you can have a
vacation, of course. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll always have an
interesting model at hand&mdash;I&#8217;ve got chests full of wonderful
costumes&mdash;genuine ones&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He fell silent,
his eyes studying her. Already he was planning half
a dozen pictures, for he was just beginning to perceive
how adaptable the girl might be. And there was about
her that indefinable something which, when a painter
discovers it, interests him and arouses his intense artistic
curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said musingly, &#8220;you are something
more than pretty, Dulcie.... I could put you in
eighteenth century clothes and you&#8217;d look logical.
Yes, and in seventeenth century clothes, too.... I
could do some amusing things with you in oriental garments....
A young Herodiade ... Calypso ...
Theodora.... She was a child, too, you know.
There&#8217;s a portrait with bobbed hair&mdash;a young girl by
Van Dyck.... You know you are quite stimulating
to me, Dulcie. You excite a painter&#8217;s imagination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
It&#8217;s rather odd,&#8221; he added naïvely, &#8220;that I never discovered
you before; and I&#8217;ve known you over two
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had seated himself on the sofa while discoursing.
Now he got up, touched a bell twice. The Finnish
maid, Selinda, with her high cheek-bones, frosty blue
eyes and colourless hair, appeared in cap and apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selinda,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take Miss Dulcie into my room.
In a long, leather Turkish box on the third shelf of
my clothes closet is a silk and gold costume and a lot
of jade jewelry. Please put her into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Dulcie Soane went away with her cat in her arms,
beside the neat and frosty-eyed Selinda; and Barres
opened a portfolio of engravings, where were gathered
the lovely aristocrats of Van Dyck and Rubens and
Gainsborough and his contemporaries&mdash;a charmingly
mixed company, separated by centuries and frontiers,
yet all characterised by a common <i>something</i>&mdash;some
inexplicable similarity which Barres recognised without
defining.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather amusing,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;but that kid,
Dulcie, seems to remind me of these people&mdash;somehow
or other.... One scarcely looks for qualities in the
child of an Irish janitor.... I wonder who her mother
was....&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When he looked up again Dulcie was standing there
on the thick rug. On her naked feet were jade bracelets,
jade-set rings on her little toes; a cascade of jade
and gold falling over her breasts to the straight, narrow
breadth of peacock hue which fell to her ankles.
And on her childish head, clasping the ruddy bobbed
hair, glittered the jade-incrusted diadem of a fairy
princess of Cathay.</p>

</div>
<p>The Prophet, gathered close to her breast, stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
back at Barres with eyes that dimmed the splendid
jade about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; he said, the tint of excitement rising
in his cheeks. &#8220;I <i>have</i> discovered a model and a
wonder! And right here is where I paint my winter
Academy&mdash;right here and right now!... And I call
it &#8216;The Prophets.&#8217; Climb up on that model stand and
squat there cross-legged, and stare at me&mdash;straight at
me&mdash;the way your cat stares!... There you are.
That&#8217;s right! Don&#8217;t move. Stay put or I&#8217;ll come
over and bow-string you!&mdash;you little miracle!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;you mean me?&#8221; faltered Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet, Sweetness! Do you know how beautiful
you are? Well, never mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He had begun already
to draw with a wet brush, and now he relapsed
into absorbed silence.</p>
<p>The Prophet watched him steadily. The studio became
intensely still.</p>

<p>The studio door bell rang while Barres was at
breakfast one morning late in June. Aristocrates
leisurely answered the door, but shut it
again immediately and walked out into the kitchenette
without any explanation.</p>
<p>Selinda removed the breakfast cover and fetched the
newspaper. Later, Aristocrates, having washed his
master&#8217;s brushes, brought them into the studio mincingly,
upon a silver service-salver.</p>
<p>&#8220;No letters?&#8221; inquired Barres, glancing up over the
morning paper and laying aside his cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;No letters, suh. No co&#8217;espondence in any shape,
fo&#8217;m or manner, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody to see me?&#8221; inquired Barres, always
amused at Aristocrates&#8217; flights of verbiage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody, suh, excusin&#8217; a persistless &#8217;viduality inquihin&#8217;
fo&#8217; you, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What persistless individuality was that?&#8221; asked
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ve&#8217;y or-nary human objec&#8217;, suh, pahshially afflicted
with one bad eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That one-eyed man? He&#8217;s been here several times,
hasn&#8217;t he? Why does he come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fo&#8217; commercial puhposes, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a pedlar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He mentions a desiah, suh, to dispose, commercially,
of vahious impo&#8217;ted materials requiahed by ahtists.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you show him the sign in the hall, &#8216;No pedlars
allowed&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaas, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not demean myse&#8217;f to repeat what this human
objec&#8217; said, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistuh Barres, suh, I totally igno&#8217;hed that man,&#8221;
replied Aristocrates languidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right. But you tell Soane to enforce the
rule against pedlars. Every day there are two or
three of them ringing at the studio, trying to sell colours,
laces, or fake oriental rugs. It annoys me. Selinda
can&#8217;t hear the bell and I have to leave my work
and open the door. Tell that persistless one-eyed man
to keep away. Tell Soane to bounce him next time he
enters Dragon Court. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaas, suh. But Soane, suh, he&#8217;s a might friendly
Irish. He&#8217;s spo&#8217;tin&#8217; &#8217;round Grogan&#8217;s nights, &#8217;longa
this here one-eyed &#8217;viduality. Yaas, suh. I done seen
&#8217;em co-gatherin&#8217; on vahious occasionalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho!&#8221; commented Barres. &#8220;It&#8217;s graft, is it? This
one-eyed pedlar meets Soane at Grogan&#8217;s and bribes
him with a few drinks to let him peddle colours in
Dragon Court! That&#8217;s the Irish of it, Aristocrates.
I began to suspect something like that. All right.
I&#8217;ll speak to Soane myself.... Leave the studio door
open; it&#8217;s warm in here.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The month of May was now turning somewhat sultry
as it melted into June. Every pivot-pane in the
big studio window had been swung wide open. The
sun had already clothed every courtyard tree with
dense and tender foliage; hyacinth and tulip were gone
and Soane&#8217;s subscription geraniums blazed in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
place like beds of coals heaped up on the grass plot of
Dragon Court.</p>
<p>But blue sky, sunshine of approaching summer, gentle
winds and freshening rains brought only restlessness
to New Yorkers that month of May.</p>
<p>Like the first two years of the war, the present year
seemed strange, unreal; its vernal breezes brought no
balm, its blue skies no content. The early summer
sunlight seemed almost uncanny in a world where, beyond
the sea, millions of men at arms swayed ceaselessly
under sun and moon alike, interlocked in one gigantic
death grip!&mdash;a horrible and blood-drenched human
chain of butchery stretching half around the
earth.</p>
<p>Into every Western human eye had come strange and
subtle shadows which did not depart with moments of
forgetful mirth, intervals of self-absorption, hours
filled with familiar interests&mdash;the passions, hopes, perplexities
of those years which were now no more.</p>
<p>Those years of yesterdays! A vast and depthless
cleft already divided them from to-day. They seemed
as remote as dusty centuries&mdash;those days of an ordered
and tranquil world&mdash;those days of little obvious
faiths unshattered&mdash;even those days of little wars, of
petty local strifes, of an almost universal calm and
peace and trust in brotherhood and in the obligations
of civilisation.</p>
<p>Familiar yesterday had vanished, its creeds forgotten.
It was already decades away, and fading like a
legend in the ever-increasing glare of the red and present
moment.</p>
<p>And the month of May seemed strange, and its soft
skies and sun seemed out of place in a world full of
dying&mdash;a world heavy with death&mdash;a western world
aloof from the raging hell beyond the seas, yet already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
tense under the distant threat of three continents in
flames&mdash;and all aquiver before the deathly menace of
that horde of blood-crazed demons still at large, still
unsubdued, still ranging the ruins of the planet which
they had so insanely set on fire.</p>
<p>Entire nations were still burning beyond the ocean;
other nations had sunk into cinders. Over the Eastern
seas the furnace breath began to be felt along the
out-thrust coast lines of the Western World. Inland,
not yet; but every seaward city became now conscious
of that first faint warning wave of heat from hell.
Millions of ears strained to catch the first hushed whisper
of the tumult. Silent in its suspense the Great
Republic listened. Only the priesthood of the deaf
and wooden gods continued voluble. But Israel had
already begun to lift up its million eyes; and its ancient
faith began to glow again; and its trust was becoming
once more a living thing&mdash;the half-forgotten
trust of Israel in that half-forgotten Lord, who, in
the beginning, had been their helper and their shield.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Through the open studio door came Dulcie Soane.
The Prophet followed at her slender heels, gently waving
an urbane tail.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>After his first smiling greeting&mdash;he always rose,
advanced, and took her hand with that pleasant appearance
of formality so adored by femininity, youthful or
mature&mdash;he resumed his seat and continued to write
his letters.</p>
<p>These finished, he stamped them, rang for Aristocrates,
picked up his palette and brushes, and pulled
out the easel upon which was the canvas for the morning.</p>
<p>Dulcie, still in the hands of Selinda, had not yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
emerged. The Prophet sat upright on the carved
table, motionless as a cat of ebony with green-jewelled
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old sport,&#8221; said Barres, stepping across the
rug to caress the cat, &#8220;you and your pretty mistress
begin to look very interesting on my canvas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prophet received the blandishments with dignified
gratitude. A discreet and feathery purring filled
the room as Barres stroked the jet black, silky fur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine cat, you are,&#8221; commented the young man,
turning as Dulcie entered.</p>
<p>She laid one hand on his extended arm and sprang
lightly to the model stand. And the next moment she
was seated&mdash;a slim, gemmed thing glimmering with imperial
jade from top to toe.</p>
<p>Barres laid the Prophet in her arms, stepped back
while Dulcie arranged the docile cat, then retreated to
his canvas.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Sweetness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the child happily. And the
morning séance was on.</p>
<p>Barres was usually inclined to ramble along conversationally
in his pleasant, detached way while at work,
particularly if work went well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were we yesterday, Dulcie? Oh, yes; we
were talking about the Victorian era and its art; and
we decided that it was not the barren desert that the
ultra-moderns would have us believe. That&#8217;s what we
decided, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> decided,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So did you, Dulcie. It was a unanimous decision.
Because we both concluded that some among the Victorians
were full of that sweet, clean sanity which alone
endures. You recollect how our decision started?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It was about my new pleasure in Tennyson,
Browning, Morris, Arnold, and Swinburne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Victorian poets, if sometimes a trifle
stilted and self-conscious, wrote nobly; makers of Victorian
prose displayed qualities of breadth, imagination
and vision and a technical cultivation unsurpassed.
The musical compositions of that epoch were melodious
and sometimes truly inspired; never brutal, never
vulgar, never degenerate. And the Victorian sculptors
and painters&mdash;at first perhaps austerely pedantic&mdash;became,
as they should be, recorders of the times and
customs of thought, bringing the end of the reign of
a great Queen to an admirable renaissance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s grey eyes never left his. And if she did
not quite understand every word, already the dawning
familiarity with his vocabulary and a general comprehension
of his modes of self-expansion permitted her
to follow him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A great Queen, a great reign, a great people,&#8221; he
rambled on, painting away all the while. &#8220;And if in
that era architecture declined toward its lowest level
of stupidity, and if taste in furniture and in the plastic,
decorative, and textile arts was steadily sinking
toward its lowest ebb, and if Mrs. Grundy trudged the
Empire, paramount, dull and smugly ferocious, while
all snobbery saluted her and the humble grovelled before
her dusty brogans, yet, Dulcie, it was a great era.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great because its faith had not been radically
impaired; it was sane because Germany had not
yet inoculated the human race with its porcine political
vulgarities, its bestial degeneracy in art.... And if,
perhaps, the sentimental in British art and literature
predominated, thank God it had not yet been tainted
with the stark ugliness, the swinish nakedness, the ferocious
leer of things Teutonic!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>He continued to paint in silence for a while. Presently
the Prophet yawned on Dulcie&#8217;s knees, displaying
a pink cavern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better rest,&#8221; he said, nodding smilingly at Dulcie.
She released the cat, who stretched, arched his back,
yawned again gravely, and stalked away over the velvety
Eastern carpet.</p>
<p>Dulcie got up lithely and followed him on little jade-encrusted,
naked feet.</p>
<p>A box of bon-bons lay on the sofa; she picked up
Rossetti&#8217;s poems, turned the leaves with jewel-laden
fingers, while with the other hand she groped for a
bon-bon, her grey eyes riveted on the pages before her.</p>
<p>During these intervals between poses it was the
young man&#8217;s custom to make chalk sketches of the girl,
recording swiftly any unstudied attitude, any unconscious
phase of youthful grace that interested him.</p>
<p>Dulcie, in the beginning, diffidently aware of this,
had now become entirely accustomed to it, and no
longer felt any responsibility to remain motionless
while he was busy with red chalk or charcoal.</p>
<p>When she had rested sufficiently, she laid aside her
book, hunted up the Prophet, who lazily endured the
gentle tyranny, and resumed her place on the model
stand.</p>
<p>And so they worked away all the morning, until
luncheon was served in the studio by Aristocrates; and
Barres in his blouse, and Dulcie in her peacock silk,
her jade, and naked feet, gravely or lightly as their
moods dictated, discussed an omelette and a pot of
tea or chocolate, and the ways and manners and customs
of a world which Dulcie now was discovering as a
brand new and most enchanting planet.</p>

<h2>IX
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />HER DAY</span></h2>
</div>
<p>June was ending in a very warm week. Work in
the studio lagged, partly because Dulcie, preparing
for graduation, could give Barres little
time; partly because, during June, that young man
had been away spending the week-ends with his parents
and his sister at Foreland Farms, their home.</p>
<p>From one of these visits he returned to the city just
in time to read a frantic little note from Dulcie Soane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Barres</span>, please, <i>please</i> come to my graduation.
I do want <i>somebody</i> there who knows me. And my father
is not well. Is it too much to ask of you? I hadn&#8217;t the
courage to speak to you about it when you were here, but I
have ventured to write because it will be so lonely for me
to graduate without having anybody there I know.</p>
<p class='sig1'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dulcie Soane.</span>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was still early in the morning; he had taken a
night train to town.</p>
<p>So when he had been freshened by a bath and change
of linen, he took his hat and went down stairs.</p>
<p>A heavy, pasty-visaged young woman sat at the
desk in the entrance hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Soane?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Where</i> is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In bed,&#8221; she replied indifferently. The woman&#8217;s
manner just verged on impertinence. He hesitated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
then walked across to the superintendent&#8217;s apartments
and entered without knocking.</p>
<p>Soane, in his own room, lay sleeping off the consequences
of an evening at Grogan&#8217;s. One glance was
sufficient for Barres, and he walked out.</p>
<p>On Madison Avenue he found a florist, selected a bewildering
bouquet, and despatched it with a hasty note,
by messenger, to Dulcie at her school. In the note
he wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be there. Cheer up!&#8221;</p>
<p>He also sent more flowers to his studio, with pencilled
orders to Aristocrates.</p>
<p>In a toy-shop he found an appropriate decoration
for the centre of the lunch table.</p>
<p>Later, in a jeweller&#8217;s, he discovered a plain gold
locket, shaped like a heart and inset with one little diamond.
A slender chain by which to suspend it was
easily chosen; and an extra payment admitted him to
the emergency department where he looked on while
an expert engraved upon the locket: &#8220;Dulcie Soane
from Garret Barres,&#8221; and the date.</p>
<p>After that he went into the nearest telephone booth
and called up several people, inviting them to dine
with him that evening.</p>
<p>It was nearly ten o&#8217;clock now. He took his little
gift, stopped a taxi, and arrived at the big brick high-school
just in time to enter with the last straggling
parents and family friends.</p>
<p>The hall was big and austerely bare, except for the
ribbons and flags and palms which decorated it. It
was hot, too, though all the great blank windows had
been swung open wide.</p>
<p>The usual exercises had already begun; there were
speeches from Authority; prayers by Divinity; choral
effects by graduating pulchritude.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>The class, attired in white, appeared to average
much older than Dulcie. He could see her now, in her
reconstructed communion dress, holding the big bouquet
which he had sent her, one madonna lily of which
she had detached and pinned over her breast.</p>
<p>Her features were composed and delicately flushed;
her bobbed hair was tucked up, revealing the snowy
neck.</p>
<p>One girl after another advanced and read or spoke,
performing the particular parlour trick assigned her
in the customary and perfectly unremarkable manner
characteristic of such affairs.</p>
<p>Rapturous parental demonstrations greeted each effort;
piano, violin and harp filled in nobly. A slight
haze of dust, incident to pedalistic applause, invaded
the place; there was an odour of flowers in the heated
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Glancing at a programme which he had found on his
seat, Barres read: &#8220;Song: Dulcie Soane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking up at her where she sat on the stage, among
her comrades in white, he noticed that her eyes were
busy searching the audience&mdash;possibly for him, he
thought, experiencing an oddly pleasant sensation at
the possibility.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The time at length arrived for Dulcie to do her parlour
trick; she rose and came forward, clasping the
big, fragrant bouquet, prettily flushed but self-possessed.
The harp began a little minor prelude&mdash;something
Irish and not very modern. Then Dulcie&#8217;s pure,
untrained voice stole winningly through the picked
harp-strings&#8217; hesitation:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>&#8220;Heart of a colleen,</p>
<p>Where do you roam?</p>
<p class='indent4'>Heart of a colleen,</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>Far from your home?</p>
<p>Laden with love you stole from her breast!</p>
<p>Wandering dove, return to your nest!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>Sodgers are sailin&#8217;</p>
<p>Away to the wars;</p>
<p class='indent4'>Ladies are wailin&#8217;</p>

<p>Heart that was part of you, Eileen Aroon?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>Lost to a sodger,</p>
<p>Gone is my heart!</p>
<p class='indent4'>Lost to a sodger,</p>
<p>Now we must part&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>I and my heart&mdash;for it journeys afar</p>
<p>Along with the sodgers who sail to the war!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>Tears that near blind me</p>
<p>My pride shall dry,&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class='indent4'>Wisha! don&#8217;t mind me!</p>
<p>Lave a lass cry!</p>
<p>Only a sodger can whistle the tune</p>
<p>That coaxes the heart out of Eileen Aroon!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>And Dulcie&#8217;s song ended.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Almost instantly the audience had divined in the
words she sang a significance which concerned them&mdash;a
warning&mdash;perhaps a prophecy. The 69th Regiment
of New York infantry was Irish, and nearly every seat
in the hall held a relative of some young fellow serving
in its ranks.</p>
<p>The applause was impulsive, stormy, persistent; the
audience was demanding the young girl&#8217;s recall; the
noise they made became overwhelming, checking the
mediating music and baffling the next embarrassed graduate,
scheduled to read an essay, and who stood there
mute, her manuscript in her hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>Finally the principal of the school arose, went over
to Dulcie, and exchanged a few words with her. Then
he came forward, hand lifted in appeal for silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The music and words of the little song you have
just heard,&#8221; he said, &#8220;were written, I have just learned,
by the mother of the girl who sang them. They were
written in Ireland a number of years ago, when Irish
regiments were sent away for over-seas service. Neither
words nor song have ever been published. Miss Soane
found them among her mother&#8217;s effects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the story of the little song might interest
you. For, somehow, I feel&mdash;as I think you all feel&mdash;that
perhaps the day may come&mdash;may be near&mdash;when
the hearts of our women, too, shall be given to
their soldiers&mdash;sons, brothers, fathers&mdash;who are &#8216;sailin&#8217;
away to the wars.&#8217; But if that time comes&mdash;which
God avert!&mdash;then I know that every man here will do
his duty.... And every woman.... And I know
that:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8216;Tears that near blind you,</p>
<p>Your pride shall dry!&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>He paused a moment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Soane has prepared no song to sing as an
encore. In her behalf, and in my own, I thank you for
your appreciation. Be kind enough to permit the exercises
to proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the graduating exercises continued.</p>
<p>Barres waited for Dulcie. She came out among the
first of those departing, walking all alone in her reconstructed
white dress, and carrying his bouquet.
When she caught sight of him, her face became radiant
and she made her way toward him through the
crowd, seeking his outstretched hand with hers, clinging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
to it in a passion of gratitude and emotion that
made her voice tremulous:</p>
<p>&#8220;My bouquet&mdash;it is so wonderful! I love every
flower in it! Thank you with all my heart. You are
so kind to have come&mdash;so kind to me&mdash;so k-kind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I who should be grateful, Dulcie, for your
charming little song,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;It was fascinating
and exquisitely done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you really like it?&#8221; she asked shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I did! And I quite fell in love with your
voice, too&mdash;with that trick you seem to possess of conveying
a hint of tears through some little grace-note
now and then.... And there <i>were</i> tears hidden in
the words; and in the melody, too.... And to think
that your mother wrote it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a short interval of silence he released her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a taxi for you,&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll drive
home in state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed again with surprise and gratitude:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are&mdash;are <i>you</i> coming, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;m going to take you home. Don&#8217;t you
belong to me?&#8221; he demanded laughingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. But her forced little smile made
the low-voiced answer almost solemn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then!&#8221; he said cheerfully. &#8220;Come along.
What&#8217;s mine I look after. We&#8217;ll have lunch together
in the studio, if you are too proud to pose for a poor
artist this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this her sensitive face cleared and she laughed
happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pride of a high-school graduate!&#8221; he commented,
as he seated himself beside her in the taxicab.
&#8220;Can anything equal it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her pride in your&mdash;friendship,&#8221; she ventured.</p>
<p>Which unexpected reply touched and surprised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear child!&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of your
friendship, too. Nothing ought to make a man prouder
than winning a young girl&#8217;s confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so kind,&#8221; she sighed, touching the blossoms
in her bouquet with slender fingers that trembled
a little. For she would have offered him a flower from
it had she found courage; but it seemed presumptuous
and she dropped her hand into her lap again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Aristocrates opened the door for them: Selinda took
her away.</p>
<p>Barres had ordered flowers for the table. In the
middle of it a doll stood, attired in academic cap and
gown, the Stars and Stripes in one hand, in the other
a green flag bearing a gold harp.</p>
<p>When Dulcie came in she stopped short, enchanted
at the sight of the decorated table. But when Aristocrates
opened the kitchen door and her three cats
came trotting in, she was overcome.</p>
<p>For each cat wore a red, white and blue cravat on
which was pinned a silk shamrock; and although
Strindberg immediately keeled over on the rug and
madly attacked her cravat with her hind toes, the general
effect remained admirable.</p>
<p>Aristocrates seated Dulcie. Upon her plate was
the box containing chain and locket. And the girl cast
a swift, inquiring glance across the centre flowers at
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s for you, Dulcie,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She turned quite pale at sight of the little gift.
After a silence she leaned on the table with both elbows,
shading her face with her hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>He let her alone&mdash;let the first tense moment in her
youthful life ebb out of it; nor noticed, apparently,
the furtive and swift touch of her best handkerchief
to her closed eyes.</p>
<p>Aristocrates brought her a little glass of frosted
orange juice. After an interval, not looking at Barres,
she sipped it. Then she took the locket and chain from
the satin-lined box, read the inscription, closed her
lids for a second&#8217;s silent ecstasy, opened them looking
at him through rapturous tears, and with her eyes still
fixed on him lifted the chain and fastened it around
her slender neck.</p>
<p>The luncheon then proceeded, the Prophet gravely
assisting from the vantage point of a neighbouring
chair, the Houri, more emotional, promenading earnestly
at the heels of Aristocrates. As for Strindberg,
she possessed neither manners nor concentration,
and she alternately squalled her desires for food or
frisked all over the studio, attempting complicated
maneuvres with every curtain-cord and tassel within
reach.</p>
<p>Dulcie had found her voice again&mdash;a low, uncertain,
tremulous little voice when she tried to thank him for
the happiness he had given her&mdash;a clearer, firmer voice
when he dexterously led the conversation into channels
more familiar and serene.</p>
<p>They talked of the graduating exercises, of her part
in them, of her classmates, of education in general.</p>
<p>She told him that since she was quite young she had
learned to play the piano by remaining for an hour
every day after school, and receiving instruction from
a young teacher who needed a little extra pin money.</p>
<p>As for singing, she had had no instruction. Her
voice had never been tried, never been cultivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have it tried some day,&#8221; he said casually.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>But Dulcie shook her head, explaining that it was
an expensive process and not to be thought of.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you pay for your piano lessons?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid twenty-five cents an hour. My mother left
a little money for me when I was a baby. I spent it
all that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I had $500. It lasted me seven years&mdash;from
the time I was ten to now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Are</i> you seventeen? You don&#8217;t look it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I don&#8217;t. My teachers tell me that my mind
is very quick but my body is slow. It annoys me to
be mistaken for a child of fifteen. And I have to dress
that way, too, because my dresses still fit me and clothes
are very expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie became confidential and loquacious:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very. You don&#8217;t know about girls&#8217; clothes, I
suppose. But they cost a very great deal. So I&#8217;ve
had to wear out dresses I&#8217;ve had ever since I was fourteen
and fifteen. And so I can&#8217;t put up my hair because
it would make my dresses look ridiculous; and
that renders the situation all the worse&mdash;to be obliged
to go about with bobbed hair, you see? There doesn&#8217;t
seem to be any way out of it,&#8221; she ended, with a despairing
little laugh, &#8220;and I was seventeen last February!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up! You&#8217;ll grow old fast enough. And now
you&#8217;re going to have a jolly little salary as my model,
and you ought to be able to buy suitable clothes.
Oughtn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer, and he repeated the question.
And drew from her, reluctantly, that her father, so
far, had absorbed what money she had earned by posing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>A dull red gathered under the young man&#8217;s cheek-bones,
but he said carelessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do. I&#8217;ll talk it over with your father.
I&#8217;m very sure he&#8217;ll agree with me that you should bank
your salary and draw out what you need for your personal
expenses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie sat silent over her fruit and bon-bons. Reaction
from the keen emotions of the day had, perhaps,
begun to have their effect.</p>
<p>They rose and reseated themselves on the sofa, where
she sat in the corner among gorgeous Chinese cushions,
her reconstructed dress now limp and shabby, the limp
madonna lily hanging from her breast.</p>
<p>It had been for her the happiest day of her life. It
had dawned the loneliest, but under the magic of this
man&#8217;s kindness the day was ending like a day in Paradise.</p>
<p>To Dulcie, however, happiness was less dependent
upon receiving than upon giving; and like all things
feminine, mature and immature, she desired to serve
where her heart was enlisted&mdash;began to experience the
restless desire to give. What? And as the question
silently presented itself, she looked up at Barres:</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I pose for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On a day like this! Nonsense, Dulcie. This is
your holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d really like to&mdash;if you want me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Curl up here and take a nap. Slip off your
gown so you won&#8217;t muss it and ask Selinda for a kimono.
Because you&#8217;re going to need your gown this
evening,&#8221; he added smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? <i>Please</i> tell me why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You&#8217;ve had enough excitement. Tell Selinda
to give you a kimono. Then you can lie down in my
room if you like. Selinda will call you in plenty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
time. And after that I&#8217;ll tell you how we&#8217;re going to
bring your holiday to a gay conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed disinclined to stir, curled up there, her
eyes brilliant with curiosity, her lips a trifle parted in
a happy smile. She lay that way for a few moments,
looking up at him, her fingers caressing the locket, then
she sat up swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I take a nap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet, flashed past him, and disappeared
in the corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to wake me!&#8221; she called back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t forget!&#8221;</p>
<p>When he heard her voice again, conversing with Selinda,
he opened the studio door and went down stairs.</p>
<p>Soane, rather the worse for wear, was at the desk,
and, standing beside him, was a one-eyed man carrying
two pedlar&#8217;s boxes under his arms. They both looked
around quickly when Barres appeared. Before he
reached the desk the one-eyed man turned and walked
out hastily into the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soane,&#8221; said Barres, &#8220;I&#8217;ve one or two things to say
to you. The first is this: if you don&#8217;t stop drinking
and if you don&#8217;t keep away from Grogan&#8217;s, you&#8217;ll lose
your job here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Musha, then, Misther Barres&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment; I&#8217;m not through. I advise you to
stop drinking and to keep away from Grogan&#8217;s. That&#8217;s
the first thing. And next, go on and graft as much
as you like, only warn your pedlar-friends to keep
away from Studio No. 9. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;F&#8217;r the love o&#8217; God&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the injured innocence, Soane. I&#8217;m telling
you how to avoid trouble, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Misther Barres, sorr! As God sees me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I can see you, too. I want you to behave, Soane.
This is friendly advice. That one-eyed pedlar who
just beat it has been bothering me. Other pedlars
come ringing at the studio and interrupt and annoy
me. You know the rules. If the other tenants care to
stand for it, all right. But I&#8217;m through. Is that
plain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, sorr,&#8221; said the unabashed delinquent. The
faintest glimmer of a grin came into his battered eyes.
&#8220;Sorra a wan o&#8217; thim ever lays a hand to No. 9 bell
or I&#8217;ll have his life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing more,&#8221; continued Barres, smiling in spite
of himself at the Irish of it all. &#8220;I am paying Dulcie
a salary&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisha then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! I tell you that she&#8217;s in my employment on
a salary. Don&#8217;t ever touch a penny of it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure the child&#8217;s wages&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they <i>don&#8217;t</i> belong to the father. Legally, perhaps,
but the law doesn&#8217;t suit me. So if you take the
money that she earns, and blow it in at Grogan&#8217;s, I&#8217;ll
have to discharge her because I won&#8217;t stand for what
you are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you do that, Mr. Barres?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly would.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Irishman scratched his curly head in frank perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie needs clothes suitable to her age,&#8221; continued
Barres. &#8220;She needs other things. I&#8217;m going to
take charge of her savings so don&#8217;t you attempt to
tamper with them. You wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing,
anyway, Soane, if this miserable drink habit hadn&#8217;t got
a hold on you. If you don&#8217;t quit, it will down you.
You&#8217;ll lose your place here. You know that. Try to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
brace up. This is a rotten deal you&#8217;re giving yourself
and your daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane wept easily. He wept now. Tearful volubility
followed&mdash;picturesque, lit up with Hibernian
flashes, then rambling, and a hint of slyness in it which
kept one weeping eye on duty watching Barres all the
while.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; behave yourself,&#8221; concluded Barres.
&#8220;And, Soane, I shall have three or four people to dinner
and a little dancing afterward. I want Dulcie to
enjoy her graduating dance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Misther Barres, you&#8217;re that kind to the
child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Somebody</i> ought to be. Do you know that there
was nobody she knew to see her graduate to-day, excepting
myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the poor darling! Sure, I was that busy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Busy sleeping off a souse,&#8221; said Barres drily.
&#8220;And by the way, who is that stolid, German-looking
girl who alternates with you here at the desk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Kurtz, sorr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. She seems stupid. Where did you dig her
up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fri&#8217;nd o&#8217; mine riccominds her highly, sorr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Who is he? One of your German pedlar
friends at Grogan&#8217;s? Be careful, Soane. You
Sinn Feiners are headed for trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and mounted the stairs. Soane looked
after him with an uneasy expression, partly humorous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, Mr. Barres,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t be botherin&#8217;
afther the likes of us poor Irish. Is there anny
harrm in a sup o&#8217; beer av a Dootchman pays?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres looked back at him:</p>
<p>&#8220;A one-eyed Dutchman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, g&#8217;wan, sorr, wid yer hokin&#8217; an&#8217; jokin&#8217;! Is it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
graft ye say? An&#8217; how can ye say it, sorr, knowin&#8217;
me as ye do, Misther Barres?&#8221;</p>
<p>The impudent grin on the Irishman&#8217;s face was too
much for the young man. He continued to mount the
stairs, laughing.</p>

<h2>X
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />HER EVENING</span></h2>
</div>
<p>As he entered the studio he heard the telephone
ringing. Presently Selinda marched in:</p>
<p>&#8220;A lady, sir, who will not giff her name, desires
to spik to Mr. Barres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t talk to anonymous people,&#8221; he said curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tell her, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Did you make Miss Dulcie comfortable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yess, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Now, take that dress of Miss Dulcie&#8217;s,
go out to some shop on Fifth Avenue, buy a
pretty party gown of similar dimensions, and bring
it back with you. Take a taxi both ways. Wait&mdash;take
her stockings and slippers, too, and buy her some
fine ones. And some underwear suitable.&#8221; He went
to a desk, unlocked it, and handed the maid a flat
packet of bank-notes. &#8220;Be sure the things are nice,&#8221;
he insisted.</p>
<p>Selinda, starched, immaculate, frosty-eyed, marched
out. She returned a few moments later, wearing jacket
and hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, the lady on the telephone hass called again.
The lady would inquire of Mr. Barres if perhaps he
has recollection of the Fountain of Marie de Médicis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres reddened with surprise and pleasure:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Yes, indeed, I&#8217;ll speak to <i>that</i> lady. Hang up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the service receiver, Selinda.&#8221; And he stepped to the
studio telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla?&#8221; he exclaimed in a low, eager voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;est moi, Thessa! Have you a letter from me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you little wretch! Oh, Thessa, you&#8217;re certainly
a piker! Fancy my not hearing one word from
you since April!&mdash;not a whisper, not a sign to tell me
that you are alive&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, hush! It was not because I did not wish
to see you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was! You knew bally well that I hadn&#8217;t
your address and that you had mine! Is that what
you call friendship?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand what you are saying. I
wanted to see you. It has been impossible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not singing and dancing anywhere in New
York. I watched the papers. I even went to the
Palace of Mirrors to enquire if you had signed with
them there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Be careful, please!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful what you say over the telephone. For
my sake, Garry. Don&#8217;t use my former name or say
anything to identify me with any place or profession.
I&#8217;ve been in trouble. I&#8217;m in trouble still. Had you
no letter from me this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is disquieting news. I posted a letter to you
last night. You should have had it in your morning
mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No letter has come from you. I had no letters at
all in the morning mail, and only one or two important
business letters since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m deeply worried. I shall have to see you
unless that letter is delivered to you by evening.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Splendid! But you&#8217;ll have to come to me, Thessa.
I&#8217;ve invited a few people to dine here and dance afterwards.
If you&#8217;ll dine with us, I&#8217;ll get another man to
balance the table. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight! This is wonderful of you, Thessa!&#8221; he said
excitedly. &#8220;If you&#8217;re in trouble we&#8217;ll clear it up between
us. I&#8217;m so happy that you will give me this
proof of friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear boy,&#8221; she said in a troubled voice. &#8220;I
should be more of a friend if I kept away from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You promise, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... Do you realise that to-night another
summer moon is to witness our reunion?... I shall
come to you once more under a full June moon.... And
then, perhaps, no more.... Never.... Unless
after the world ends I come to you through shadowy
outer space&mdash;a ghost drifting&mdash;a shred of mist
across the moon, seeking you once more!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor child,&#8221; he said laughing, &#8220;you must be in
no end of low spirits to talk that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does sound morbid. But I have plenty of courage,
Garry. I shall not snivel on the starched bosom
of your evening shirt when we meet. Donc, à bientôt,
monsieur. Soyez tranquille! You shall not be ashamed
of me among your guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy!&#8221; he laughed happily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,
Thessa. We&#8217;ll fix up whatever bothers you. Eight
o&#8217;clock! Don&#8217;t forget!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not likely to,&#8221; she said.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Until Selinda returned from her foray along Fifth
Avenue, Barres remained in the studio, lying in his
armchair, still possessed by the delightful spell, still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
excited by the prospect of seeing Thessalie Dunois
again, here, under his own roof.</p>
<p>But when the slant-eyed and spotlessly blond Finn
arrived, he came back out of his retrospective trance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get some pretty things for Miss Soane?&#8221;
he enquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yess, sir, be-ootiful.&#8221; Selinda deposited on the
table a sheaf of paid bills and the balance of the bank-notes.
&#8220;Would Mr. Barres be kind enough to inspect
the clothes for Miss Soane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks. You say they&#8217;re all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yess, sir. They are heavenly be-ootiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Tell Aristocrates to lay out my clothes
after you have dressed Miss Dulcie. There will be two
extra people to dinner. Tell Aristocrates. Is Miss
Dulcie still asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yess, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Wake her in time to dress her so she
can come out here and give me a chance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
glanced at the clock &#8220;Better wake her now, Selinda.
It&#8217;s time for her to dress and evacuate my quarters.
I&#8217;ll take forty winks here until she&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres lay dozing on the sofa when Dulcie came in.</p>
<p>Selinda, enraptured by her own efficiency in grooming
and attiring the girl, marched behind her, unable
to detach herself from her own handiwork.</p>
<p>From crown to heel the transfiguration was absolute&mdash;from
the point of her silk slipper to the topmost
curl on the head which Selinda had dressed to perfection.</p>
<p>For Selinda had been a lady&#8217;s maid in great houses,
and also had a mania for grooming herself with the
minute and thorough devotion of a pedigreed cat. And
Dulcie emerged from her hands like some youthful sea-nymph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
out of a bath of foam, snowy-sweet as some
fresh and slender flower.</p>
<p>With a shy courage born with her own transfiguration,
she went to Barres, where he lay on the sofa, and
bent over him.</p>
<p>She had made no sound; perhaps her nearness awoke
him, for he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I please you?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>He sat up abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonderful child!&#8221; he said, frankly astonished.
Whereupon he got off the sofa, walked all around her
inspecting her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a get-up! What a girl!&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;You lovely little thing, you astound me! Selinda, you
certainly know a thing or two. Take it from me, you
do Miss Soane and yourself more credit in your way
than I do with paint and canvas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie blushed vividly; the white skin of Selinda also
reddened with pleasure at her master&#8217;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Aristocrates to fix my bath and lay out my
clothes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve guests coming and I&#8217;ve got to
hustle!&#8221; And to Dulcie: &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a little
party in honour of your graduation. That&#8217;s what I
have to tell you, dear. Does it please you? Do your
pretty clothes please you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl, overwhelmed, could only look at him. Her
lips, vivid and slightly parted, quivered as her breath
came irregularly. But she found no words&mdash;nothing
to say except in the passionate gratitude of her grey
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear child,&#8221; he said gently. Then, after a moment&#8217;s
silence, he eased the tension with his quick smile:
&#8220;Wonder-child, go and seat yourself very carefully,
and be jolly careful you don&#8217;t rumple your frock, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
I want you to astonish one or two people this
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie found her voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m so astonished at myself that I don&#8217;t seem
real. I seem to be somebody else&mdash;long ago!&#8221; She
stepped close to him, opened her locket for his inspection,
holding it out to him as far as the chain permitted.
It framed a miniature of a red-haired, grey-eyed
girl of sixteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. How perfectly it fits into my locket! I carry
it always in my purse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might easily be yourself, Dulcie,&#8221; he said in a
low voice. &#8220;You are her living image.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That is what astonishes me. To-night, for
the first time in my life, it occurred to me that I look
like this girl picture of my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never thought so before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221; She stood looking down at the laughing
face in the locket for a few moments, then, lifting her
eyes to his:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been made over, in a day, to look like this....
You did it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! Selinda and her curling iron did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They laughed a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have made me. You began to
make me all over three months ago&mdash;oh, longer ago
than that!&mdash;you began to remake me the first time you
ever spoke to me&mdash;the first time you opened your door
to me. That was nearly two years ago. And ever since
I have been slowly becoming somebody quite new&mdash;inside
and outside&mdash;until to-night, you see, I begin to
look like my mother.&#8221; She smiled at him, drew a deep
breath, closed the locket, dropped it on her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t keep you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wanted to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the picture&mdash;so you can understand what you have done
for me to make me look like that.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Barres returned to the studio, freshened and
groomed for the evening, he found Dulcie at the piano,
playing the little song she had sung that morning, and
singing the words under her breath. But she ceased
as he came up, and swung around on the piano-stool
to confront him with the most radiant smile he had
ever seen on a human face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a day this has been!&#8221; she said, clasping her
hands tightly. &#8220;I simply cannot make it seem real.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t ended yet, either. There&#8217;s a night to every
day, you know. And your graduation party will begin
in a few moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. I&#8217;m fearfully excited. You&#8217;ll stay near
me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet! Did I tell you who are coming? Well,
then, you won&#8217;t feel strange, because I&#8217;ve merely asked
two or three men who live in Dragon Court&mdash;men you
see every day&mdash;Mr. Trenor, Mr. Mandel, and Mr.
Westmore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have asked Miss Souval&mdash;that
tall, pretty girl who sometimes sits for Mr. Trenor&mdash;Damaris
Souval. You remember her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;Mr. Mandel wishes to bring
a young married woman who has developed a violent
desire for the artistic and informal, but who belongs
in the Social Register.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right
if Corot Mandel wants her. Her name is Mrs. Helmund&mdash;Elsena
Helmund. Mr. Trenor is painting her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s face was serious but calm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And then, to even the table,&#8221; concluded Barres
smilingly, &#8220;I invited a girl I knew long ago in Paris.
Her name is Thessalie Dunois; and she&#8217;s very lovely to
look upon, Dulcie. I am very sure you will like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence; then the electric bell rang in
the corridor, announcing the arrival of the first guest.
As Barres rose, Dulcie laid her hand on his arm&mdash;a
swift, involuntary gesture&mdash;as though the girl were
depending on his protection.</p>
<p>The winning appeal touched him and amused him,
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have the prettiest
frock in the studio&mdash;if you need that knowledge
to reassure you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The corridor door opened and closed. Somebody
went into his bedroom with Selinda&mdash;that being the
only available cloak-room for women.</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />HER NIGHT</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Thessalie Dunois! This is charming of
you!&#8221; said Barres, crossing the studio swiftly
and taking her hand in both of his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see you, Garry&mdash;&#8221; she looked past
him across the studio at Dulcie, and her voice died out
for a moment. &#8220;Who is that girl?&#8221; she enquired under
her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll present you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait. <i>Who</i> is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie Soane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Soane?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll tell you about her later&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a moment, Garry.&#8221; Thessalie looked across the
room at the girl for a second or two longer, then turned
a troubled, preoccupied gaze on Barres. &#8220;Have you
a letter from me? I posted it last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. He could hear more guests entering
the corridor beyond. A faint smile&mdash;the forced
smile of courage&mdash;altered Thessalie&#8217;s features now, until
it became a fixed and pretty mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrive to give me a moment alone with you this
evening,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;My need is great, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you say! Now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I want to talk to that young girl first.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked over to where Dulcie stood by the piano,
silent and self-possessed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thessa,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is Miss Soane, who graduated
from high school to-day, and in whose honour I
am giving this little party.&#8221; And to Dulcie he said:
&#8220;Miss Dunois and I were friends when I lived in France.
Please tell her about your picture, which you and I are
doing.&#8221; He turned as he finished speaking, and went
forward to welcome Esmé Trenor and Damaris Souval,
who happened to arrive together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the cunning little girl over there!&#8221; exclaimed
the tall and lovely Damaris, greeting Barres with cordial,
outstretched hands. &#8220;Where did you find such
an engaging little thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t recognise her?&#8221; he asked, amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I? No. Should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s Dulcie Soane, the girl at the desk down-stairs!&#8221;
said Barres, delighted. &#8220;This is her party.
She has just graduated from high school, and she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belongs to Barres,&#8221; interrupted Esmé Trenor in
his drawling voice. &#8220;Unusual, isn&#8217;t she, Damaris?&mdash;logical
anatomy, ornamental, vague development; nice
lines, not obvious&mdash;like yours, Damaris,&#8221; he added impudently.
Then waving his lank hand with its over-polished
nails: &#8220;I like the indefinite accented with one
ripping value. Look at that hair!&mdash;lac and burnt
orange rubbed in, smeared, then wiped off with the
thumb! You follow the intention, Barres?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk too much, Esmé,&#8221; interrupted Damaris
tartly. &#8220;Who is that lovely being talking to the little
Soane girl, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of my Paris days&mdash;Thessalie Dunois&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Again he checked himself to turn and greet Corot Mandel,
subtle creator and director of exotic spectacles&mdash;another
tall and rather heavily built man, with a mop
of black and shiny hair, a monocle, and sanguine features
slightly oriental.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>With Corot Mandel had come Elsena Helmund&mdash;an
attractive woman of thoroughbred origin and formal
environment, and apparently fed up with both. For
she frankly preferred &#8220;grades&#8221; to &#8220;registered stock,&#8221;
and she prowled through every art and theatrical purlieu
from the Mews to Westchester, in eternal and unquiet
search for an antidote to the sex-ennui which she
erroneously believed to be an intellectual necessity for
self-expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that winning child with red hair?&#8221; she enquired,
nodding informal recognition to the other
guests, whom she already knew. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me,&#8221; she
added, elevating a quizzing glass and staring at Dulcie,
&#8220;that this engaging infant has a history already! It
isn&#8217;t possible, with that April smile in her child eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet she hasn&#8217;t a history, Elsena,&#8221; said Barres,
frowning; &#8220;and I&#8217;ll see that she doesn&#8217;t begin one as
long as she&#8217;s in my neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corot Mandel, who had been heavily inspecting Dulcie
through his monocle, now stood twirling it by its
frayed and greasy cord:</p>
<p>&#8220;I could do something for her&mdash;unless she&#8217;s particularly
yours, Barres?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seldom seen
a better type in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You idiot. Don&#8217;t you recognise her? She&#8217;s Dulcie
Soane! You could have picked her yourself if you&#8217;d
had any flaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell,&#8221; murmured Mandel, disgusted. &#8220;And I
thought I possessed flaire. Your private property, I
suppose?&#8221; he added sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely. Keep off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch me,&#8221; murmured Corot Mandel, with a wry
face, as they moved forward to join the others and be
presented to the little guest of the evening.</p>
<p>Westmore came in at the same moment&mdash;a short,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
blond, vigorous young man, who knew everybody except
Thessalie, and proceeded to smash the ice in characteristic
fashion:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie! You beautiful child! How are you,
duckey?&#8221;&mdash;catching her by both hands,&mdash;&#8220;a little salute
for Nunky? Yes?&#8221;&mdash;kissing her heartily on both
cheeks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a gift for you in my overcoat pocket.
We&#8217;ll sneak out and get it after dinner!&#8221; He gave her
hands a hearty squeeze, turned to the others: &#8220;I ought
to have been Miss Soane&#8217;s godfather. So I appointed
myself as such. Where are the cocktails, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Road-to-ruin cocktails were served&mdash;frosted orange
juice for Dulcie. Everybody drank her health. Then
Aristocrates gracefully condescended to announce dinner.
And Barres took out Dulcie, her arm resting light
as a snowflake on his sleeve.</p>
<p>There were flowers everywhere in the dining-room;
table, buffet, curtains, lustres were gay with early blossoms,
exhaling the haunting scent of spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it, Dulcie?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>She merely turned and looked at him, quite unable
to speak, and he laughed at her brilliant eyes and
flushed cheeks, and, dropping his right hand, squeezed
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your party, Sweetness&mdash;all yours! You must
have a good time every minute!&#8221; And he turned, still
smiling, to Thessalie Dunois on his left:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite wonderful, Thessa, to have you here&mdash;to
be actually seated beside you at my own table. I shall
not let you slip away from me again, you enchanting
ghost!&mdash;and leave me with a dislocated heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, that sounds almost sentimental. We&#8217;re not,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know? You never gave me a chance to
be sentimental.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>She laughed mirthlessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never gave you a chance? And our brief but headlong
career together, monsieur? What was it but a
continuous cataract of chances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we were laughing our silly heads off every minute!
I had no opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>That seemed to amuse her and awaken the ever-latent
humour in her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Opportunity,&#8221; she observed demurely, &#8220;should be
created and taken, not shyly awaited with eyes rolled
upward and a sucked thumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed outright. Her colour rose; the
old humorous challenge was in her eyes again; the
subtle mask was already slipping from her features,
revealing them in all their charming recklessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know my creed,&#8221; she said; &#8220;to go forward&mdash;laugh&mdash;and
accept what Destiny sends you&mdash;still
laughing!&#8221; Her smile altered again, became, for a
moment, strange and vague. &#8220;God knows that is what
I am doing to-night,&#8221; she murmured, lifting her slim
glass, in which the gush of sunny bubbles caught the
candlelight. &#8220;To Destiny&mdash;whatever it may be!
Drink with me, Garry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Around them the chatter and vivacity increased, as
Damaris ended a duel of wit with Westmore and prepared
for battle with Corot Mandel. Everybody
seemed to be irresponsibly loquacious except Dulcie,
who sat between Barres and Esmé Trenor, a silent,
smiling, reserved little listener. For Barres was still
conversationally involved with Thessalie, and Esmé
Trenor, languid and detached, being entirely ignored
by Damaris, whom he had taken out, awaited his own
proper modicum of worship from his silent little neighbour
on his left&mdash;which tribute he took for granted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
was his sacred due, and which, hitherto, he had invariably
received from woman.</p>
<p>But nobody seemed to be inclined to worship; Damaris
scarcely deigned to notice him, his impudence,
perhaps, still rankling. Thessalie, laughingly engaged
with Barres, remained oblivious to the fashionable
portrait painter. As for Elsena Helmund, that
youthful matron was busily pretending to comprehend
Corot Mandel&#8217;s covert orientalisms, and secretly wondering
whether they were, perhaps, as improper as
Westmore kept whispering to her they were, urging her
to pick up her skirts and run.</p>
<p>Esmé Trenor permitted a few weary but slightly
disturbed glances to rest on Dulcie from time to time,
but made no effort to entertain her.</p>
<p>And she, on her part, evinced no symptoms of worshipping
him. And all the while he was thinking to
himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can this be the janitor&#8217;s daughter? Is she the
same rather soiled, impersonal child whom I scarcely
ever noticed&mdash;the thin, immature, negligible little
drudge with a head full of bobbed red hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>His lack of vision, of finer discernment, deeply annoyed
him. Her lack of inclination to worship him,
now that she had the God-sent opportunity, irritated
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The silly little bounder,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;how can she
sit beside me without timidly venturing to entertain
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stole another profoundly annoyed glance at Dulcie.
The child was certainly beautiful&mdash;a slim, lovely,
sensitive thing of qualities so delicate that the painter
of pretty women became even more surprised and
chagrined that it had taken Barres to discover this desirable
girl in the silent, shabby child of Larry Soane.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Presently he lurched part way toward her in his
chair, and looked at her with bored but patronising
encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me,&#8221; he said languidly.</p>
<p>Dulcie turned and looked at him out of uninterested
grey eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to me,&#8221; he repeated pettishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to yourself,&#8221; retorted Dulcie, and turned
again to listen to the gay nonsense which Damaris and
Westmore were exchanging amid peals of general
laughter.</p>
<p>But Esmé Trenor was thunderstruck. A deep and
painful colour stained his pallid features. Never before
had mortal woman so flouted him. It was unthinkable.
It really wouldn&#8217;t do. There must be some explanation
for this young girl&#8217;s monstrous attitude toward
offered opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he insisted, still very red, &#8220;are you bashful,
by any chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie slowly turned toward him again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I am bashful; not now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Then wouldn&#8217;t you like to talk to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy! And why not, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I haven&#8217;t anything to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, that is the incentive to all conversation&mdash;lack
of anything to say. You should practise the
art of saying nothing politely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> should have practised it enough to say good
morning to me during these last five years,&#8221; said Dulcie
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! You&#8217;re rather severe, you know! You
were just a little thing running about underfoot!&mdash;I&#8217;m
sorry you feel angry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I do not. But how can I have anything to talk to
you about, Mr. Trenor, when you have never even
noticed me all these years, although often I have handed
you your keys and your letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite stupid of me. I&#8217;m sorry. But a man,
you see, doesn&#8217;t notice children&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some men do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Mr. Barres! That <i>is</i> unkind. Why rub
it in, Dulcie? I&#8217;m rather an interesting fellow, after
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; she asked absently.</p>
<p>Her honest indifference to him was perfectly apparent
to Esmé Trenor. This would never do. She must
be subdued, made sane, disciplined!</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he drawled, leaning lankly nearer,
dropping both arms on the cloth, and fixing his heavy-lidded
eyes intensely on her,&#8220;&mdash;do you know&mdash;do you
guess, perhaps, why I never spoke to you in all these
years?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not trouble yourself to speak to me, I
imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wrong. I was <i>afraid</i>!&#8221; And he stared at
her pallidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid?&#8221; she repeated, puzzled.</p>
<p>He leaned nearer, confidential, sad:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you a precious secret, Dulcie? I am a
coward. I am a slave of fear. I am afraid of beauty!
Isn&#8217;t that a very strange thing to say? Can you understand
the subtlety of that indefinable psychology?
Fear is an emotion. Fear of the beautiful is still a
subtler emotion. Fear, itself, is beautiful beyond words.
Beauty is Fear. Fear is Beauty. Do you follow me,
Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the girl, bewildered.</p>
<p>Esmé sighed:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Some day you will follow me. It is my destiny to
be followed, pursued, haunted by loveliness impotently
seeking to express itself to me, while I, fearing it, dare
only to express my fear with brush and pencil!...
<i>When</i> shall I paint you?&#8221; he added with sad benevolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When shall I try to interpret upon canvas my subtle
fear of you?&#8221; And, as the girl remained mute:
&#8220;When,&#8221; he explained languidly, &#8220;shall I appoint an
hour for you to sit to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Barres&#8217;s model,&#8221; she said, flushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to arrange it with him, then,&#8221; he
nodded, wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy! Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I do not wish to sit to anybody except Mr.
Barres,&#8221; she said candidly, &#8220;and what you paint does
not interest me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you familiar with my work?&#8221; he asked incredulously.</p>
<p>She shook her head, shrugged, and turned to Barres,
who had at last relinquished Thessalie to Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Sweetness,&#8221; he said gaily, &#8220;do you get on
with Esmé Trenor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He talked,&#8221; she said in a voice perfectly audible to
Esmé.</p>
<p>Barres glanced toward Esmé, secretly convulsed, but
that young apostle of Fear had swung one thin leg over
the other and was now presenting one shoulder and the
back of his head to them both, apparently in delightful
conversation with Elsena Helmund, who was fed
up on him and his fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must always talk to your neighbours at dinner,&#8221;
insisted Barres, still immensely amused. &#8220;Esmé
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
is a very popular man with fashionable women, Dulcie,&mdash;a
painter in much demand and much adored....
Why do you smile?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie smiled again, deliciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; continued Barres, &#8220;you must now give
the signal for us to rise by standing up. I&#8217;m so proud
of you, Dulcie, darling!&#8221; he added impulsively; &#8220;&mdash;and
everybody is mad about you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You made me&mdash;&#8221; she laughed mischievously, &#8220;&mdash;out
of a rag and a bone and a hank of hair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You made yourself out of nothing, child! And
everybody thinks you delightful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear girl!&mdash;of course I do. Does it make such
a difference to you, Dulcie&mdash;my affection for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it&mdash;<i>affection</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is. Didn&#8217;t you know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;know&mdash;what it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is affection. Who could be with you
as I have been and not grow tremendously fond of
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ever did except you. Mr. Westmore was
always nice. But&mdash;but you are so kind&mdash;I can&#8217;t express&mdash;I&mdash;c-can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Her emotion checked her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try, dear!&#8221; he said hastily. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
in to have a jolly dance now. You and I begin it together.
Don&#8217;t you let any other fellow take you
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up, laughed blissfully, gazing at him
with brilliant eyes a little dimmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll all be at your heels,&#8221; he said, beginning to
comprehend the beauty he had let loose on the world,
&#8220;&mdash;every man-jack of them, mark my prophecy! But
ours is the first dance, Dulcie. Promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. And I promise you the next&mdash;please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m host,&#8221; he said doubtfully, and a trifle
taken aback. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have some other dances together,
anyway. But I couldn&#8217;t monopolise you, Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked at him silently, then her grey, intelligent
eyes rested directly on Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you dance with her?&#8221; she asked gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. And with the others, too. Tell
me, Dulcie, did you find Miss Dunois agreeable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you ought to like her. She&#8217;s very attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is quite beautiful,&#8221; said the girl, watching
Thessalie across his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she really is. What did you and she talk
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; replied Dulcie, determined to have no further
commerce with Thessalie Dunois which involved
a secrecy excluding Barres. &#8220;She asked me if he were
not my father. Then she asked me a great many stupid
questions about him. And about Miss Kurtz, who
takes the desk when father is out. Also, she asked
me about the mail and whether the postman delivered
letters at the desk or in the box outside, and about the
tenants&#8217; mail boxes, and who distributed the letters
through them. She seemed interested,&#8221; added the girl
indifferently, &#8220;but I thought it a silly subject for conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, much perplexed, sat gazing at Dulcie in silence
for a moment, then recollecting his duty, he
smiled and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up, now, Dulcie. You are running this
show.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flushed and rose, and the others stood up.
Barres took her to the studio door, then returned to
the table with the group of men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he exclaimed happily, &#8220;what do you fellows
think of Soane&#8217;s little girl now? Isn&#8217;t she the sweetest
thing you ever heard of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A peach!&#8221; said Westmore, in his quick, hearty voice.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the idea, Garry? Is it to be her career, this
posing business? And where is it going to land her?
In the Winter Garden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it going to land <i>you</i>?&#8221; added Esmé impudently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know, myself,&#8221; replied Barres, with
a troubled smile. &#8220;The little thing always appealed
to me&mdash;her loneliness and neglect, and&mdash;and something
about the child&mdash;I can&#8217;t define it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibilities?&#8221; suggested Mandel viciously. &#8220;Take
it from me, you&#8217;re some picker, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Anyway, I&#8217;ve given her the run of my
place for the last two years and more. And she has
been growing up all the while, and I didn&#8217;t notice it.
And suddenly, this spring, I discovered her for the
first time.... And&mdash;well, look at her to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s your private model, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; persisted Mandel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely,&#8221; replied Barres drily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selfish dog!&#8221; remarked Westmore, with his lively,
wholesome laugh. &#8220;I once asked her to sit for me&mdash;more
out of good nature than anything else. And a
jolly fine little model she ought to make you, Garry.
She&#8217;s beginning to acquire a figure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s quite wonderful that way, too,&#8221; nodded
Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undraped?&#8221; inquired Esmé.</p>
<p>&#8220;A miracle,&#8221; nodded Barres absently. &#8220;Paint is becoming
inadequate. I shall model her this summer. I
tell you I have never seen anything to compare to her.
Never!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What else will you do with her?&#8221; drawled Esmé.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll go stale on her some day, of course. Am I
next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>No</i>!... I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;ll do. It begins
to look like a responsibility, doesn&#8217;t it? She&#8217;s such a
fine little girl,&#8221; explained Barres warmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve grown
quite fond of her&mdash;interested in her. Do you know
she has an excellent mind? And nice, fastidious instincts?
She <i>thinks</i> straight. That souse of a father
of hers ought to be jailed for the way he neglects her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you thinking of adopting her?&#8221; asked Trenor,
with the faintest of sneers, which escaped Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adopt a <i>girl</i>? Oh, Lord, no! I can&#8217;t do anything
like that. Yet&mdash;I hate to think of her future,
too ... unless somebody looks out for her. But it
isn&#8217;t possible for <i>me</i> to do anything for her except
to give her a good job with a decent man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning yourself,&#8221; commented Mandel, acidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>am</i> decent,&#8221; retorted Barres warmly, amid
general laughter. &#8220;You fellows know what chances
she might take with some men,&#8221; he added, laughing at
his own warm retort.</p>
<p>Esmé and Corot Mandel nodded piously, each perfectly
aware of what chance any attractive girl would
run with his predatory neighbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;To shift the subject of discourse&mdash;that girl, Thessalie
Dunois,&#8221; began Westmore, in his energetic way,
&#8220;is about the cleverest and prettiest woman I&#8217;ve seen
in New York outside the theatre district.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I met her in France,&#8221; said Barres, carelessly.
&#8220;She really is wonderfully clever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall let her talk to me,&#8221; drawled Esmé, flicking
at his cigarette. &#8220;It will be a liberal education for
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandel&#8217;s slow, oriental eyes blinked contempt; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
caressed his waxed moustache with nicotine-stained fingers:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to direct an out-of-door spectacle&mdash;a
sort of play&mdash;not named yet&mdash;up your way, Barres&mdash;at
Northbrook. It&#8217;s for the Belgians.... If Miss
Dunois&mdash;unless,&#8221; he added sardonically, &#8220;you have her
reserved, also&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! You cast Thessalie Dunois and she&#8217;ll
make your show for you, Mandel!&#8221; exclaimed Barres.
&#8220;I know and I&#8217;m telling you. Don&#8217;t make any mistake:
there&#8217;s a girl who can make good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Is she a professional?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was on the tip of Barres&#8217;s tongue to say
&#8220;Rather!&#8221; But he checked himself, not knowing Thessalie&#8217;s
wishes concerning details of her incognito.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to her about it,&#8221; he said, rising.</p>
<p>The others laid aside cigars and followed him into
the studio, where already the gramophone was going
and Aristocrates and Selinda were rolling up the rugs.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres and Dulcie danced until the music, twice revived,
expired in husky dissonance, and a new disc was
substituted by Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;By heaven!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll dance this with my godchild
or I&#8217;ll murder you, Garry. Back up, there!&mdash;you
soulless monopolist!&#8221; And Dulcie, half laughing,
half vexed, was swept away in Westmore&#8217;s vigorous
arms, with a last, long, appealing look at Barres.</p>
<p>The latter danced in turn with his feminine guests,
as in duty bound&mdash;in pleasure bound, as far as concerned
Thessalie.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think, to <i>think</i>,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;that you and
I, who once trod the moonlit way, June-mad, moon-mad,
should be dancing here together once more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;though this is June again, moon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
and madness are lacking. So is the enchanted river
and your canoe. And so is that gay heart of mine&mdash;that
funny, careless little heart which was once my
comrade, sending me into a happy gale of laughter
every time it counselled me to folly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, there is so much the matter that I don&#8217;t
know how to tell you.... And yet, I have nobody
else to tell.... Is that maid of yours German?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Finnish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be certain,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Your
guests are all American, are they not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the little Soane girl? Are her sympathies
with Germany?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly not! What gave you that idea,
Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>The music ran down; Westmore, the indefatigable,
still keeping possession of Dulcie, went over to wind
up the gramophone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there some place where I could be alone with
you for a few minutes?&#8221; whispered Thessalie.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a balcony under the middle window. It
overlooks the court.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded and laid her hand on his arm, and they
walked to the long window, opened it, and stepped out.</p>
<p>Moonlight fell into the courtyard, silvering everything.
Down there on the grass the Prophet sat, motionless
as a black sphynx in the lustre of the moon.</p>
<p>Thessalie looked down into the shadowy court, then
turned and glanced up at the tiled roof just above
them, where a chimney rose in silhouette against the
pale radiance of the sky.</p>
<p>Behind the chimney, flat on their stomachs, lay two
men who had been watching, through an upper ventilating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
pane of glass, the scene in the brilliantly
lighted studio below them.</p>
<p>The men were Soane and his crony, the one-eyed pedlar.
But neither Thessalie nor Barres could see them
up there behind the chimney.</p>
<p>Yet the girl, as though some unquiet instinct warned
her, glanced up at the eaves above her head once more,
and Barres looked up, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see up there?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.... There could be nobody up there to
listen, could there?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would want to climb up on the roof to spy on
you or me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so loud, Garry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same trouble that drove me out of France,&#8221;
she said in a low voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me what it was.
All I can tell you is this: I am followed everywhere
I go. I cannot make a living. Whenever I secure an
engagement and return at the appointed time to fill
it, something happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens?&#8221; he asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They repudiate the agreement,&#8221; she said in a quiet
voice. &#8220;They give no reasons; they simply tell me
that they don&#8217;t want me. Do you remember that evening
when I left the Palace of Mirrors?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was only one example. I left with an excellent
contract, signed. The next day, when I returned,
the management took my contract out of my hands
and tore it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Why, that&#8217;s outrageous&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! That is only one instance. Everywhere it
is the same. I am accepted after a try-out; then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
without apparent reason, I am told not to return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean there is some conspiracy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began
incredulously, but she interrupted him with a white
hand over his, nervously committing him to silence:</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Garry! Men have followed me here from
Europe. I am constantly watched in New York. I
cannot shake off this surveillance for very long at a
time. Sooner or later I become conscious again of
curious eyes regarding me; of features that all at once
become unpleasantly familiar in the throng. After
several encounters in street or car or restaurant, I
recognise these. Often and often instinct alone warns
me that I am followed; sometimes I am so certain of
it that I take pains to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you prove it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what the devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush! I seem to be getting into deeper trouble
than that, Garry. I have changed my residence so
many, many times!&mdash;but every time people get into my
room when I am away and ransack my effects....
And now I never enter my room unless the landlady
is with me, or the janitor&mdash;especially after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen! I am not really frightened. It isn&#8217;t fear,
Garry. That word isn&#8217;t in my creed, you know. But
it bewilders me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the name of common sense,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;what
reason has anybody to annoy you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand tightened on his:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only knew who these people are&mdash;whether they
are agents of the Count d&#8217;Eblis or of the&mdash;the French
Government! But I can&#8217;t determine. They steal letters
directed to me; they steal letters which I write
and mail with my own hands. I wrote to you yesterday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
because I&mdash;I felt I couldn&#8217;t stand this persecution&mdash;any&mdash;longer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice became unsteady; she waited, gripping his
hand, until self-control returned. When she was mistress
of herself again, she forced a smile and her tense
hand relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is most annoying to have
my little love-letter to you intercepted.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his features remained very serious:</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you mail that letter to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From a hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>He considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to have had it this morning, Thessa. But
the mails, lately, have been very irregular. There have
been other delays. This is probably an example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At latest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you should have my letter
this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes. But the evening is young yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a moment she drew a light sigh of relief, or
perhaps of apprehension, he was not quite sure which.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about this other matter&mdash;men following and
annoying you,&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, Garry. I can&#8217;t talk about it now. Wait
until we are sure about my letter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Thessa&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please! If you don&#8217;t receive it before I leave, I
shall come to you again and ask your aid and advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come <i>here</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Now take me in.... Because I am not
quite certain about your maid&mdash;and perhaps one other
person&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His expression of astonishment checked her for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
moment, then the old irresistible laughter rang out
sweetly in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry! It is funny, isn&#8217;t it!&mdash;to be dogged
and hunted day and night by a pack of shadows? If
I only knew who casts them!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took his arm gaily, with that little, courageous
lifting of the head:</p>
<p>&#8220;Allons! We shall dance again and defy the devil!
And you may send your servant down to see whether
my letter has arrived&mdash;not that maid with slanting
eyes!&mdash;I have no confidence in her&mdash;but your marvellous
major-domo, Garry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her smile was bright and untroubled as she stepped
back into the studio, leaning on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear boy,&#8221; she whispered, with the irresponsible
undertone of laughter ringing in her voice, &#8220;thank
you for bothering with my woes. I&#8217;ll be rid of them
soon, I hope, and then&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I&#8217;ll lead you another
dance along the moonlit way!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the roof, close to the chimney, the one-eyed man
and Soane peered down into the studio through the
smeared ventilator.</p>
<p>In the studio Dulcie&#8217;s first party was drawing to an
early but jolly end.</p>
<p>She had danced a dozen times with Barres, and her
heart was full of sheerest happiness&mdash;the unreasoning
bliss which asks no questions, is endowed with
neither reason nor vision&mdash;the matchless delight which
fills the candid, unquestioning heart of Youth.</p>
<p>Nothing had marred her party for her, not even the
importunity of Esmé Trenor, which she had calmly
disregarded as of no interest to her.</p>
<p>True, for a few moments, while Barres and Thessalie
were on the balcony outside, Dulcie had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
a trifle subdued. But the wistful glances she kept
casting toward the long window were free from meaner
taint; neither jealousy nor envy had ever found lodging
in the girl&#8217;s mind or heart. There was no room
to let them in now.</p>
<p>Also, she was kept busy enough, one man after another
claiming her for a dance. And she adored it&mdash;even
with Trenor, who danced extremely well when
he took the trouble. And he was taking it now with
Dulcie; taking a different tone with her, too. For if
it <i>were</i> true, as some said, that Esmé Trenor was three-quarters
charlatan, he was no fool. And Dulcie began
to find him entertaining to the point of a smile or
two, as her spontaneous tribute to Esmé&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>That languid apostle said afterward to Mandel,
where they were lounging over the piano:</p>
<p>&#8220;Little devil! She&#8217;s got a mind of her own, and
she knows it. I&#8217;ve had to make efforts, Corot!&mdash;efforts,
if you please, to attract her mere attention. I&#8217;m
exhausted!&mdash;never before had to make any efforts&mdash;never
in my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandel&#8217;s heavy-lidded eyes of a big bird rested on
Dulcie, where she was seated. Her gaze was lifted to
Barres, who bent over her in jesting conversation.</p>
<p>Mandel, watching her, said to Esmé:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always ready to <i>train</i>&mdash;that sort of girl; always
on the lookout for them. One discovers a specimen
once or twice in a decade.... Two or three in a
lifetime: that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Train them?&#8221; repeated Esmé, with an indolent
smile. &#8220;Break them, you mean, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The breaking, however, is usually mutual.
However, that girl could go far under my direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she could go as far as hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean artistically,&#8221; remarked Mandel, undisturbed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&#8220;As what, for example?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As anything. After all, I <i>have</i> flaire, even if it
failed me this time. But <i>now</i> I see. It&#8217;s there, in her&mdash;what
I&#8217;m always searching for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What may that be, dear friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Westmore calls &#8216;the goods.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And just what are they in her case?&#8221; inquired
Esmé, persistent as a stinging gnat around a pachyderm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;a voice, maybe; maybe the dramatic
instinct&mdash;genius as a dancer&mdash;who knows? All that is
necessary is to discover it&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;and
then direct it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late, O philanthropic Pasha!&#8221; remarked Esmé
with a slight sneer. &#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad to paint her,
too, and become good friends with her&mdash;so would many
an honest man, now that she&#8217;s been discovered&mdash;but
our friend Barres, yonder, isn&#8217;t likely to encourage
either you or me. So&#8221;&mdash;he shrugged, but his languid
gaze remained on Dulcie&mdash;&#8220;so you and I had better
kiss all hope good-bye and toddle home.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Westmore and Thessalie still danced together; Mrs.
Helmund and Damaris were trying new steps in new
dances, much interested, indulging in much merriment.
Barres watched them casually, as he conversed with
Dulcie, who, deep in an armchair, never took her eyes
from his smiling face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Sweetness,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;it&#8217;s early yet, I
know, but your party ought to end, because you are
coming to sit for me in the morning, and you and I
ought to get plenty of sleep. If we don&#8217;t, I shall have
an unsteady hand, and you a pair of sleepy eyes.
Come on, ducky!&#8221; He glanced across at the clock:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very early yet, I know,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;but you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and I have had rather a long day of it. And it&#8217;s been
a very happy one, hasn&#8217;t it, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>As she smiled, the youthful soul of her itself seemed
to be gazing up at him out of her enraptured eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; he said, with deepest satisfaction. &#8220;Now,
you&#8217;ll put your hand on my arm and we&#8217;ll go around
and say good-night to everybody, and then I&#8217;ll take
you down stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>So she rose and placed her hand lightly on his arm,
and together they made her adieux to everybody, and
everybody was cordially demonstrative in thanking her
for her party.</p>
<p>So he took her down stairs to her apartment, off
the hall, noticing that neither Soane nor Miss Kurtz
was on duty at the desk, as they passed, and that a
pile of undistributed mail lay on the desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rotten,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;Will you have to
change your clothes, sort this mail, and sit here until
the last mail is delivered?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wanted you to go to sleep. Where is Miss
Kurtz?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is her evening off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your father ought to be here,&#8221; he said, irritated,
looking around the big, empty hallway.</p>
<p>But Dulcie only smiled and held out her slim hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sleep, anyway. I had really much rather
sit here for a while and dream it all over again. Good-night....
Thank you&mdash;I can&#8217;t say what I feel&mdash;but
m-my heart is very faithful to you, Mr. Barres&mdash;will
always be&mdash;while I am alive ... because you are my
first friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped impulsively and touched her hair with
his lips:</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear child,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I <i>am</i> your friend.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>Halfway up the western staircase he called back:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring me up, Dulcie, when the last mail comes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; she nodded, almost blindly.</p>
<p>Out of her lovely, abashed eyes she watched him
mount the stairs, her cheeks a riot of surging colour.
It was some few minutes after he was gone that she
recollected herself, turned, and, slowly traversing the
east corridor, entered her bedroom.</p>
<p>Standing there in darkness, vaguely silvered by reflected
moonlight, she heard through her door ajar the
guests of the evening descending the western staircase;
heard their gay adieux exchanged, distinguished Esmé&#8217;s
impudent drawl, Westmore&#8217;s lively accents, Mandel&#8217;s
voice, the easy laughter of Damaris, the smooth, affected
tones of Mrs. Helmund.</p>
<p>But Dulcie listened in vain for the voice which had
haunted her ears since she had left the studio&mdash;the
lovely voice of Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>If this radiant young creature also had departed
with the other guests, she had gone away in silence....
<i>Had</i> she departed? Or was she still lingering
upstairs in the studio for a little chat with the most
wonderful man in the world?... A very, very beautiful
girl.... And the most wonderful man in the
world. Why should they not linger for a little chat
together after the others had departed?</p>
<p>Dulcie sighed lightly, pensively, as one whose happiness
lies in the happiness of others. To be a witness
seemed enough for her.</p>
<p>For a little while longer she remained standing there
in the silvery dusk, quite motionless, thinking of Barres.</p>
<p>The Prophet lay asleep, curled up on her bed; her
alarm clock ticked noisily in the darkness, as though
to mimic the loud, fast rhythm of her heart.</p>
<p>At last, and as in a dream, she groped for a match,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
lighted the gas jet, and began to disrobe. Slowly,
dreamily, she put from her slender body the magic
garments of light&mdash;<i>his</i> gift to her.</p>
<p>But under these magic garments, clothing her newborn
soul, remained the radiant rainbow robe of that
new dawn into which this man had led her spirit. Did
it matter, then, what dingy, outworn clothing covered
her, outside?</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Clad once more in her shabby, familiar clothes, and
bedroom slippers, Dulcie opened the door of her dim
room, and crept out into the whitewashed hall, moving
as in a trance. And at her heels stalked the Prophet,
softly, like a lithe shape that glides through dreams.</p>
<p>Awaiting the last mail, seated behind the desk on the
worn leather chair, she dropped her linked fingers into
her lap, and gazed straight into an invisible world peopled
with enchanting phantoms. And, little by little,
they began to crowd her vision, throng all about
her, laughing, rosy wraiths floating, drifting, whirling
in an endless dance. Everywhere they were invading
the big, silent hall, where the candle&#8217;s grotesque shadows
wavered across whitewashed wall and ceiling.
Drowsily, now, she watched them play and sway around
her. Her head drooped; she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The Prophet sat there, staring back at her out of
depthless orbs of jade, in which all the wisdom and
mysteries of the centuries seemed condensed and concentrated
into a pair of living sparks.</p>

<h2>XII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE LAST MAIL</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The last mail had not yet arrived at Dragon
Court.</p>
<p>Five people awaited it&mdash;Dulcie Soane, behind
the desk in the entrance hall, already wandering drowsily
with Barres along the fairy borderland of sleep;
Thessalie Dunois in Barres&#8217; studio, her rose-coloured
evening cloak over her shoulders, her slippered foot
tapping the dance-scarred parquet; Barres opposite,
deep in his favourite armchair, chatting with her;
Soane on the roof, half stupid with drink, watching
them through the ventilator; and, lurking in the moonlit
court, outside the office window, the dimly sinister
figure of the one-eyed man. He wore a white handkerchief
over his face, with a single hole cut in it.
Through this hole his solitary optic was now fixed upon
the back of Dulcie&#8217;s drowsy head.</p>
<p>As for the Prophet, perched on the desk top, he continued
to gaze upon shapes invisible to all things mortal
save only such as he.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The postman&#8217;s lively whistle aroused Dulcie. The
Prophet, knowing him, observed his advent with indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, girlie,&#8221; he said;&mdash;he was a fresh-faced and
flippant young man. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Pop?&#8221; he added, depositing
a loose sheaf of letters on the desk before her
and sketching in a few jig steps with his feet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she murmured, patting with one
slim hand her pink and yawning lips, and watching him
unlock the post-box and collect the outgoing mail.
He lingered a moment to caress the Prophet, who endured
it without gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;You better go to bed if you want to grow up to be
a big, sassy girl some day,&#8221; he advised Dulcie. &#8220;And
hurry up about it, too, because I&#8217;m going to marry
you if you behave.&#8221; And, with a last affable caress
for the Prophet, the young man went his way, singing
to himself, and slamming the iron grille smartly behind
him.</p>
<p>Dulcie, rising from her chair, sorted the mail, sleepily
tucking each letter and parcel into its proper
pigeon-hole. There was a thick letter for Barres.
This she held in her left hand, remembering his request
that she call him up when the last mail arrived.</p>
<p>This she now prepared to do&mdash;had already reseated
herself, her right hand extended toward the telephone,
when a shadow fell across the desk, and the Prophet
turned, snarled, struck, and fled.</p>
<p>At the same instant grimy fingers snatched at the
letter which she still held in her left hand, twisted it
almost free of her desperate clutch, tore it clean in
two at one violent jerk, leaving her with half the letter
still gripped in her clenched fist.</p>
<p>She had not uttered a sound during the second&#8217;s
struggle. But instantly an ungovernable rage blazed
up in her at the outrage, and she leaped clean over the
desk and sprang at the throat of the one-eyed man.</p>
<p>His neck was bony and muscular; she could not compass
it with her slender hands, but she struck at it
furiously, driving a sound out of his throat, half roar,
half cough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me my letter!&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
if you don&#8217;t!&#8221; Her furious little hands caught his
clenched fist, where the torn letter protruded, and she
tore at it and beat upon it, her teeth set and her grey
Irish eyes afire.</p>
<p>Twice the one-eyed man flung her to her knees on
the pavement, but she was up again and clinging to
him before he could tear free of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;My letter!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I shall kill you, I tell
you&mdash;unless you return it!&#8221;</p>
<p>His solitary yellow eye began to glare and glitter
as he wrenched and dragged at her wrists and arms
about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schweinstück!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Let los, mioche de
malheur! Eh! Los!&mdash;or I strike! No? Also! Attrape!&mdash;sale
gallopin!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His blow knocked her reeling across the hall.
Against the whitewashed wall she collapsed to her
knees, got up half stunned, the clang of the outer grille
ringing in her very brain.</p>
<p>With dazed eyes she gazed at the remnants of the
torn letter, still crushed in her rigid fingers. Bright
drops of blood from her mouth dripped slowly to the
tessellated pavement.</p>
<p>Reeling still from the shock of the blow, she managed
to reach the outer door, and stood swaying there,
striving to pierce with confused eyes the lamplit darkness
of the street. There was no sign of the one-eyed
man. Then she turned and made her way back to
the desk, supporting herself with a hand along the wall.</p>
<p>Waiting a few moments to control her breathing and
her shaky limbs, she contrived finally to detach the
receiver and call Barres. Over the wire she could hear
the gramophone playing again in the studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please may I come up?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Has the last mail come? Is there a letter for
me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... I&#8217;ll bring you w-what there is&mdash;if you&#8217;ll
let me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Sweetness! Come right up!&#8221; And she
heard him say: &#8220;It&#8217;s probably your letter, Thessa.
Dulcie is bringing it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her limbs and body were still quivering, and she
felt very weak and tearful as she climbed the stairway
to the corridor above.</p>
<p>The nearer door of his apartment was open.
Through it the music of the gramophone came gaily;
and she went toward it and entered the brilliantly illuminated
studio.</p>
<p>Soane, who still lay flat on the roof overhead, peeping
through the ventilator, saw her enter, all dishevelled,
grasping in one hand the fragments of a letter.
And the sight instantly sobered him. He tucked
his shoes under one arm, got to his stockinged feet,
made nimbly for the scuttle, and from there, descending
by the service stair, ran through the courtyard into
the empty hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be gorry,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;thot dommed Dootchman
has done it now!&#8221; And he pulled on his shoes, crammed
his hat over his ears, and started east, on a run, for
Grogan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Grogan&#8217;s was still the name of the Third Avenue
saloon, though Grogan had been dead some years, and
one Franz Lehr now presided within that palace of
cherrywood, brass and pretzels.</p>
<p>Into the family entrance fled Soane, down a dim
hallway past several doors, from behind which sounded
voices joining in guttural song; and came into a rear
room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>The one-eyed man sat there at a small table, piecing
together fragments of a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, then,&#8221; cried Soane, &#8220;phwat th&#8217; devil did
ye do, Max?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man barely glanced at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vy iss it,&#8221; he enquired tranquilly, &#8220;you don&#8217;d vatch
Nihla Quellen by dot wentilator some more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I axe ye,&#8221; shouted Soane, &#8220;what t&#8217;hell ye done to
Dulcie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vat I haff done already yet?&#8221; queried the one-eyed
man, not looking up, and continuing to piece together
the torn letter. &#8220;Vell, I tell you, Soane; dot
kid she keep dot letter in her handt, und I haff to grab
it. Sacré saligaud de malheur! Dot letter she tear
herself in two. Pas de chance! Your kid she iss mad
like tigers! Voici&mdash;all zat rests me de la sacré-nom-de
sacrèminton de lettre&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, shut up, y&#8217;r Dootch head-cheese!&mdash;wid y&#8217;r gillipin&#8217;
gallopin&#8217; gabble!&#8221; cut in Soane wrathfully.
&#8220;D&#8217;ye mind phwat ye done? It&#8217;s not petty larceny, ye
omadhoun!&mdash;it&#8217;s highway robbery ye done&mdash;bad cess
to ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>The one-eyed man shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pourtant, I must haff dot letter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he observed,
undisturbed by Soane&#8217;s anger; but Soane cut him short
again fiercely:</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; y&#8217;r dommed letter! Phwat do you care
if I&#8217;m fired f&#8217;r this night&#8217;s wurruk? Y&#8217;r letter, is it?
An&#8217; what about highway robbery, me bucko! An&#8217; me
off me post! How&#8217;ll I be explaining that? Ah, ye
sicken me entirely, ye Dootch square-head! Now,
phwat&#8217;ll I say to them? Tell me that, Max Freund!
Phwat&#8217;ll I tell th&#8217; aygent whin he comes runnin&#8217;?
Phwat&#8217;ll I tell th&#8217; po-lice? Arrah, phwat&#8217;t&#8217;hell do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
care, anyway?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind f&#8217;r to knock
the block off ye&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall say to dot agent you haff gone out to
smell,&#8221; remarked Max Freund placidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smell, is it? Smell what, ye dom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You smell some smoke. You haff fear of fire. You
go out to see. Das iss so simble, ach! Take shame,
you Irish Sinn Fein! You behave like rabbits!&#8221; He
pointed to his arrangement of the torn letter on the
table: &#8220;Here iss sufficient already&mdash;regardez! Look
once!&#8221; He laid one long, soiled and bony finger on
the fragments: &#8220;Read it vat iss written!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, read!&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane, still cursing under his breath, bent over the
table, reading as Freund&#8217;s soiled finger moved:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fein plots,&#8221; he read. &#8220;German agents ... disloyal
propa ... explo ... bomb fac ... shipping
munitions to ... arms for Ireland can be ... destruction
of interned German li ... disloyal newspapers
which ... controlled by us in Pari ... Ferez
Bey ... bankers are duped.... I need your advi
... hounded day and ni ... d&#8217;Eblis or Govern ...
not afraid of death but indignant ... Sinn Fei&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane&#8217;s scowl had altered, and a deeper red stained
his brow and neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by God!&#8221; he muttered, jerking up a chair
from behind him and seating himself at the table, but
never taking his fascinated eyes off the torn bits of
written paper.</p>
<p>Presently Freund got up and went out. He returned
in a few moments with a large sheet of wrapping
paper and a pot of mucilage. On this paper, with
great care, he arranged the pieces of the torn letter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
neatly gumming each bit and leaving a space between
it and the next fragment.</p>
<p>&#8220;To fill in iss the job of Louis Sendelbeck,&#8221; remarked
Freund, pasting away industriously. &#8220;Is it
not time we learn how much she knows&mdash;this Nihla
Quellen? Iss she sly like mice? I ask it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane scratched his curly head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be gorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;av that purty girrl is a Frinch
spy she don&#8217;t look the parrt, Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund waved one unclean hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Vas iss it to look like somedings? Nodding! Also,
you Sinn Fein Irish talk too much. Why iss it in Belfast
you march mit drums und music? To hold our
tongues und vatch vat iss we Germans learn already
first! Also! Sendelbeck shall haff his letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; phwat d&#8217;ye mean to do with that girrl, Max?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vatch her! Vy you don&#8217;d go back by dot wentilator
already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Faith, I&#8217;m done f&#8217;r th&#8217; evenin&#8217;, an&#8217; I thank
God I wasn&#8217;t pinched on the leads!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vait I catch dot Nihla somevares,&#8221; muttered
Freund, regarding his handiwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll do no dirty thrick to her? Th&#8217; Sinn Fein will
shtand f&#8217;r no burkin&#8217;, mind that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach, wass!&#8221; grunted Freund; &#8220;iss it your business
vat iss done to somebody by Ferez? If you Irish
vant your rifles und machine guns, leaf it to us Germans
und dond speak nonsense aboud nodding!&#8221; He
leaned over and pushed a greasy electric button:
&#8220;Now ve drink a glass bier. Und after, you go home
und vatch dot girl some more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Av Misther Barres an&#8217; th&#8217; yoong lady makes a holler,
they&#8217;ll fire me f&#8217;r this,&#8221; snarled Soane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sei ruhig, mon vieux! Nihla Quellen keeps like a
mouse quiet! Und she keeps dot yoong man quiet!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
You see! No, no! Not for Nihla to make some foolishness
und publicity. French agents iss vatching for
her too&mdash;l&#8217;affaire du <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>. She iss vat you
say, &#8216;in Dutch&#8217;! Iss she, vielleicht, a German spy?
In France they believe it. Iss she a French spy? Ach!
Possibly some day; not yet! And it iss for us Germans
to know always vat she iss about. Dot iss my affair,
not yours, Soane.&#8221;</p>
<p>A heavy jowled man in a soiled apron brought two
big mugs of beer and retired on felt-slippered feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoch!&#8221; grunted Freund, burying his nose in his
frothing mug.</p>
<p>Soane, wasting no words, drank thirstily. After a
long pull he shoved aside his sloppy stein, rose, cautiously
unlatched the shutter of a tiny peep-hole in the
wall, and applied one eye to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad luck!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;there do be wan av thim
secret service lads drinkin&#8217; at the bar! I&#8217;ll not go
home yet, Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dot big vone?&#8221; inquired Freund, mildly interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the buck! Him wid th&#8217; phony whiskers an&#8217;
th&#8217; Dootch get-up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vell, vot off it? Can he do somedings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how should I know phwat that lad can do to
th&#8217; likes o&#8217; me, or phwat the divil brings him here at
all, at all! Sure, he&#8217;s been around these three nights
running&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund laughed his contempt for all things American,
including police and secret service, and wiped his
chin with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, once, Soane! Do these Yankees know vat
it iss a police, a gendarme, a military intelligence?
Vat they call secret service, wass iss it? I ask it?
Schweinerei! Dummheit? Fantoches! Imbeciles! Of
the Treasury they haff a secret service; of the Justice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Department also another; and another of the
Army, and yet another of the Posts! Vot kind of
foolish system iss it?&mdash;mitout no minister, no chef, no
centre, no head, no organisation&mdash;und everybody interfering
in vot efferybody iss doing und nobody knowing
vot nobody is doing&mdash;ach wass! Je m&#8217;en moque&mdash;I
make mock myself at dot secret service which iss too
dam dumm!&#8221; He yawned. &#8220;Trop bête,&#8221; he added indistinctly.</p>
<p>Soane, reassured, lowered the shutter, came back to
the table, and finished his beer with loud gulps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lave us go up to the lodge till he goes out,&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;Maybe th&#8217; boys have news o&#8217; thim rifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund yawned again, nodded, and rose, and they
went out to an unlighted and ill-smelling back stairway.
It was so narrow that they had to ascend in
single file.</p>
<p>Half way up they set off a hidden bell, by treading
on some concealed button under foot; and a man,
dressed only in undershirt and trousers, appeared at
the top of the stairs, silhouetted against a bright light
burning on the wall behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; he said, recognising them, and turned
on his heel carelessly, pocketing a black-jack.</p>
<p>They followed to a closed door, which was made
out of iron and painted like quartered oak. In the wall
on their right a small shutter slid back noiselessly, then
was closed without a sound; and the iron door opened
very gently in their faces.</p>
<p>The room they entered was stifling&mdash;all windows being
closed&mdash;in spite of a pair of electric fans whirling
and droning on shelves. Some perspiring Germans were
playing skat over in a corner. One or two other men
lounged about a centre table, reading Irish and German
newspapers published in New York, Chicago, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Milwaukee. There were also on file there copies of the
<i>Evening Mail</i>, the <i>Evening Post</i>, a Chicago paper, and
a pile of magazines, including numbers of <i>Pearson&#8217;s</i>,
<i>The Fatherland</i>, <i>The Masses</i>, and similar publications.</p>
<p>Two lithograph portraits hung side by side over
the fireplace&mdash;Robert Emmet and Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Otherwise, the art gallery included photographs of Von
Hindenburg, Von Bissing, and the King of Greece.</p>
<p>A large map, on which the battle-line in Europe had
been pricked out in red pins, hung on the wall. Also
a map of New York City, on a very large scale; another
map of New York State; and a map of Ireland. A
dumb-waiter, on duty and astonishingly noiseless, slid
into sight, carrying half a dozen steins of beer and
some cheese sandwiches, just as Soane and Freund entered
the room, and the silent iron door closed behind
them of its own accord and without any audible click.</p>
<p>The man who had met them on the stairs, in undershirt
and trousers, went over to the dumb-waiter, scribbled
something on a slate which hung inside the shelf,
set the beer and sandwiches beside the skat players,
and returned to seat himself at the table to which
Freund and Soane had pulled up cane-bottomed chairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, in rather a pleasant voice, &#8220;did you
get that letter, Max?&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund nodded and leisurely sketched in the episode
at Dragon Court.</p>
<p>The man, whose name was Franz Lehr, and who had
been born in New York of German parents, listened
with lively interest to the narrative. But he whistled
softly when it ended:</p>
<p>&#8220;You took a few chances, Max,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right, of course, because you got away with it,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He whistled again, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sendelbeck must haff his letter. Yess? Also!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I guess that was the only way&mdash;if she
was really going to take it up to young Barres. And
I guess you&#8217;re right when you conclude that Nihla
won&#8217;t make any noise about it and won&#8217;t let her friend,
Barres, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m right,&#8221; grunted Freund. &#8220;We got the
goots on her now. You bet she&#8217;s scared. You tell
Ferez&mdash;yess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; he&#8217;ll hear it all. You got that letter
on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hand it to Hochstein&#8221;&mdash;he half turned on his rickety
chair and addressed a squat, bushy-haired man
with very black eyebrows and large, angry blue eyes&mdash;&#8220;Louis,
Max got that letter you saw Nihla writing in
the Hotel Astor. Here it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; taking the pasted
fragments from Freund and passing them over to
Hochstein. &#8220;Give it to Sendelbeck, along with the
blotter you swiped after she left the writing room.
Dave Sendelbeck ought to fix it up all right for Ferez
Bey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hochstein nodded, shoved the folded brown paper
into his pocket, and resumed his cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is thim rifles&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Soane; but Lehr laid a
hand on his shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen! They&#8217;re on the way to Ireland now.
I told you that. When I hear they&#8217;re landed I&#8217;ll let
you know. You Sinn Feiners don&#8217;t understand how to
wait. If things don&#8217;t happen the way you want and
when you want, you all go up in the air!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; how manny hundred years would ye have us
wait f&#8217;r to free th&#8217; ould sod!&#8221; retorted Soane.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not free it with your mouth,&#8221; retorted Lehr.
&#8220;No, nor by drilling with banners and arms in Cork
and Belfast, and parading all over the place!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;that&mdash;so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it&#8217;s so! The way to make England sick is
to stick her in the back, not make faces at her across the
Irish Channel. If your friends in the Clan-na-Gael,
and your poets and professors who call themselves
Sinn Feiners, will quit their childish circus playing and
trust us, we&#8217;ll show you how to make the Lion yowl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, bombs an&#8217; fires an&#8217; shtrikes is all right, too.
An&#8217; proppygandy is fine as far as it goes. But the
Clan-na-Gael is all afire f&#8217;r to start the shindy in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You start it,&#8221; interrupted Lehr, &#8220;before you&#8217;re
really ready, and you&#8217;ll see where it lands the Clan-na-Gael
and the Sinn Fein! I tell you to leave it to
Berlin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I tell ye lave it to the Clan-na-Gael!&#8221; retorted
Soane, excitedly. &#8220;Musha&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For why you yell?&#8221; yawned Freund, displaying a
very yellow fang. &#8220;Dot big secret service slob, he iss
in the bar hinunter. Perhaps he hear you if like a
pig you push forth cries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lehr raised his eyebrows; then, carelessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only a State agent. Johnny Klein is keeping
an eye on him. What does that big piece of cheese expect
to get by hanging out in my bar?&#8221;</p>
<p>Freund yawned again, appallingly; Soane said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder is that purty Frinch girrl agin us Irish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she care about the Irish?&#8221; replied Lehr.
&#8220;Her danger to us lies in the fact that she may blab
about Ferez to some Frenchman, and that he may believe
her in spite of all the proof they have in Paris
against her. Max,&#8221; he added, turning to Freund, &#8220;it&#8217;s
funny that Ferez doesn&#8217;t do something to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haff no orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll get &#8217;em when Ferez reads that letter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
He&#8217;s certainly not going to let that girl go about blabbing
and writing letters&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane struck the table with doubled fist:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll do no vi&#8217;lence to anny wan!&#8221; he cut in. &#8220;The
Sinn Fein will shtand for no dirrty wurruk in America!
Av you set fires an&#8217; blow up plants, an&#8217; kidnap
ladies, an&#8217; do murther, g&#8217;wan, ye Dootch scuts!&mdash;it&#8217;s
your business, God help us!&mdash;not ours.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we axe of ye is machine-goons, an&#8217; rifles, an&#8217;
ships to land them; an&#8217; av ye don&#8217;t like it, phway th&#8217;
divil d&#8217;ye come botherin&#8217; th&#8217; likes of us Irish wid y&#8217;r
proppygandy! Sorra the day,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I tuk up
wid anny Dootchman at all at all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lehr and Freund exchanged expressionless glances.
The former dropped a propitiating hand on Soane&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can it,&#8221; he said good-humouredly. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying
to help you Irish to what you want. You want Irish
independence, don&#8217;t you? All right. We&#8217;re going to
help you get it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A bell rang; Lehr sprang to his feet and hastened
out through the iron door, drawing his black-jack from
his hip pocket as he went.</p>
<p>He returned in a few moments, followed by a very
good-looking but pallid man in rather careless evening
dress, who had the dark eyes of a dreamer and the
delicate features of a youthful acolyte.</p>
<p>He saluted the company with a peculiarly graceful
gesture, which recognition even the gross creatures at
the skat table returned with visible respect.</p>
<p>Soane, always deeply impressed by the presence of
Murtagh Skeel, offered his chair and drew another one
to the table.</p>
<p>Skeel accepted with a gently preoccupied smile, and
seated himself gracefully. All that is chivalrous, romantic,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
courteous, and brave in an Irishman seemed to
be visibly embodied in this pale man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;from a dinner at Sherry&#8217;s.
A common hatred of England brought together
the dozen odd men with whom I have been in conference.
Ferez Bey was there, the military attachés of
the German, Austrian, and Turkish embassies, one or
two bankers, officials of certain steamship lines, and a
United States senator.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sipped a glass of plain water which Lehr had
brought him, thanked him, then turning from Soane
to Lehr:</p>
<p>&#8220;To get arms and munitions into Ireland in substantial
quantities requires something besides the U-boats
which Germany seems willing to offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was fully discussed to-night. Not that I
have any doubt at all that Sir Roger will do his part
skilfully and fearlessly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will that!&#8221; exclaimed Soane, &#8220;God bless him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen, Soane,&#8221; said Murtagh Skeel, with a wistful
and involuntary upward glance from his dark eyes.
Then he laid his hand of an aristocrat on Soane&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;What I came here to tell you is this: I
want a ship&#8217;s crew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want a crew ready to mutiny at a signal from me
and take over their own ship on the high seas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their own ship, sorr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their own ship. That is what has been decided.
The ship to be selected will be a fast steamer loaded
with arms and munitions for the British Government.
The Sinn Fein and the Clan-na-Gael, between them, are
to assemble the crew. I shall be one of that crew.
Through powerful friends, enemies to England, it will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
be made possible to sign such a crew and put it aboard
the steamer to be seized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her officers will, of course, be British. And I
am afraid there may be a gun crew aboard. But that
is nothing. We shall take her over when the time
comes&mdash;probably off the Irish coast at night. Now,
Soane, and you, Lehr, I want you to help recruit a
picked crew, all Irish, all Sinn Feiners or members of
the Clan-na-Gael.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the sort. Absolutely reliable, fearless,
and skilled men devoted soul and body to the cause for
which we all would so cheerfully die.... Will you
do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence. Soane moistened his lips reflectively.
Lehr, intelligent, profoundly interested,
kept his keen, pleasant eyes on Murtagh Skeel. Only
the droning electric fans, the rattle of a newspaper, the
slap of greasy cards at the skat table, the slobbering
gulp of some Teuton, guzzling beer, interrupted the
sweltering quiet of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Misther Murtagh, sorr,&#8221; said Soane with a light,
careless laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;ve wan recruit f&#8217;r to bring ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it&#8217;s meself, sorr&mdash;av ye&#8217;ll sign the likes o&#8217;
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks; of course,&#8221; said Skeel, with one of his
rare smiles, and taking Soane&#8217;s hand in comradeship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Lehr, coolly; &#8220;but my name won&#8217;t do.
Call me Grogan, if you like, and I&#8217;ll sign with you,
Mr. Skeel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skeel pressed the offered hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;A splendid beginning,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted you
both. Now, see what you can do in the Sinn Fein
and Clan-na-Gael for a crew which, please God, we
shall require very soon!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />A MIDNIGHT TÊTE-À-TÊTE</span></h2>
</div>
<p>When Dulcie had entered the studio that evening,
her white face smeared with blood and
a torn letter clutched in her hand, the gramophone
was playing a lively two-step, and Barres and
Thessalie Dunois were dancing there in the big, brilliantly
lighted studio, all by themselves.</p>
<p>Thessalie caught sight of Dulcie over Barres&#8217;s shoulder,
hastily slipped out of his arms, and hurried across
the polished floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; she asked breathlessly, a fearful
intuition already enlightening her as her startled
glance travelled from the blood on Dulcie&#8217;s face to the
torn fragments of paper in her rigidly doubled fingers.</p>
<p>Barres, coming up at the same moment, slipped a
firm arm around Dulcie&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you badly hurt, dear? What has happened?&#8221;
he asked very quietly.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, mute, her bruised mouth quivering,
and held out the remains of the letter. And
Thessalie Dunois caught her breath sharply as her eyes
fell on the bits of paper covered with her own handwriting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a man hiding in the court,&#8221; said Dulcie.
&#8220;He wore a white cloth over his face and he came up
behind me and tried to snatch your letter out of my
hand; but I held fast and he only tore it in two.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>Barres stared at the sheaf of torn paper, lying crumpled
up in his open hand, then his amazed gaze rested
on Thessalie:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the letter you wrote to me?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. May I have the remains of my letter?&#8221; she
asked calmly.</p>
<p>He handed over the bits of paper without a word,
and she opened her gold-mesh bag and dropped them in.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he strike you, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when he thought he couldn&#8217;t get away from
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hung on to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie stepped closer, impulsively, and framed
Dulcie&#8217;s pallid, blood-smeared face in both of her cool,
white hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has cut your lower lip inside,&#8221; she said. And,
to Barres: &#8220;Could you get something to bathe it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres went away to his own room. When he returned
with a finger-bowl full of warm water, some
powdered boric acid, cotton, and a soft towel, Dulcie
was lying deep in an armchair, her lids closed; and
Thessalie sat beside her on one of the padded arms,
smoothing the ruddy, curly hair from her forehead.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes when Barres appeared, giving
him a clear but inscrutable look. Thessalie gently
washed the traces of battle from her face, then rinsed
her lacerated mouth very tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just a little cut,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Your lip is a
trifle swelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; murmured Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel all right?&#8221; inquired Barres anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sleepy.&#8221; She sat erect, always with her grey
eyes on Barres. &#8220;I think I will go to bed.&#8221; She stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
up, conscious, now, of her shabby clothes and slippers;
and there was a painful flush on her face as she thanked
Thessalie and bade her a confused good-night.</p>
<p>But Thessalie took the girl&#8217;s hand and retained it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say anything about what happened,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;May I ask it of you as a very great favour?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie turned her eyes on Barres in silent appeal for
guidance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind not saying anything about this affair,&#8221;
he asked, &#8220;as long as Miss Dunois wishes it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I not tell my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even to him,&#8221; replied Thessalie gently. &#8220;Because
it won&#8217;t ever happen again. I am very certain
of that. Will you trust my word?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Dulcie looked at Barres, who nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise never to speak of it,&#8221; she said in a low,
serious voice.</p>
<p>Barres took her down stairs. At the desk she
pointed out, at his request, the scene of recent action.
Little by little he discovered, by questioning her, what
a dogged battle she had fought there alone in the whitewashed
corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call for help?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.... I didn&#8217;t think of it. And when
he got away I was dizzy from the blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>At her bedroom door he took both her hands in his.
The gas-jet was still burning in her room. On the
bed lay her pretty evening dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; she remarked naïvely, &#8220;that I had on
my old clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled, drew her to him, and lightly smoothed the
thick, bright hair from her brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am becoming very fond
of you, Dulcie. You&#8217;re such a splendid girl in every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
way.... We&#8217;ll always remain firm friends, won&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in perplexity and trouble I want you to feel
that you can always come to me. Because&mdash;you do
like me, don&#8217;t you, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment or two she sustained his smiling,
questioning gaze, then laid her cheek lightly against
his hands, which still held both of hers imprisoned.
And for one exquisite instant of spiritual surrender
her grey eyes closed. Then she straightened herself
up; he released her hands; she turned slowly and entered
her room, closing the door very gently behind
her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In the studio above, Thessalie, still wearing her rose-coloured
cloak, sat awaiting him by the window.</p>
<p>He crossed the studio, dropped onto the lounge beside
her, and lighted a cigarette. Neither spoke for
a few moments. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa, don&#8217;t you think you had better tell me
something about this ugly business which seems to involve
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I shall not take the risk of dragging you
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are these people who seem to be hounding
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You trust me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, her face partly averted:</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that. And I had meant to tell you something
concerning this matter&mdash;tell you just enough so
that I might ask your advice. In fact, that is what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
I wrote you in that letter&mdash;being rather scared and
desperate.... But half my letter to you has been
stolen. The people who stole it are clever enough to
piece it out and fill in what is missing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned impulsively and took his hands between
her own. Her face had grown quite white.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much harm have I done to you, Garry? Have
I already involved you by writing as much as I did
write? I have been wondering.... I couldn&#8217;t bear
to bring anything like that into your life&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything like what?&#8221; he asked bluntly. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you tell me, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s too complicated&mdash;too terrible. There are
elements in it that would shock and disgust you....
And perhaps you would not believe me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government of a great European Power does
not believe me to be honest!&#8221; she said very quietly.
&#8220;Why should you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled faintly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a dear,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;But you
talk like a boy. What do you really know about me?
We have met just three times in our entire lives. Do
any of those encounters really enlighten you? If you
were a business man in a responsible position, could you
honestly vouch for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you credit me with common sense?&#8221; he insisted
warmly.</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Garry, dear, not with very much. Even I
have more than you, and that is saying very little.
We are inclined to be irresponsible, you and I&mdash;inclined
to take the world lightly, inclined to laugh, inclined
to tread the moonlit way! No, Garry, neither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
you nor I possess very much of that worldly caution
born of hardened wisdom and sharpened wits.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled almost tenderly at him and pressed his
hands between her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had been worldly wise,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I should
never have danced my way to America through summer
moonlight with you. If I had been wiser still, I
should not now be an exile, my political guilt established,
myself marked for destruction by a great European
Power the instant I dare set foot on its soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I supposed your trouble to be political,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221; She sighed, looked at him with a weary
little smile. &#8220;But, Garry, I am not guilty of being
what that nation believes me to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sure of it,&#8221; he said gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you would be. You&#8217;d believe in me anyway,
even with the terrible evidence against me.... I don&#8217;t
suppose you&#8217;d think me guilty if I tell you that I am
not&mdash;in spite of what they might say about me&mdash;might
prove, apparently.&#8221;</p>
<p>She withdrew her hands, clasped them, her gaze lost
in retrospection for a few moments. Then, coming to
herself with a gesture of infinite weariness:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no use, Garry. I should never be believed.
There are those who, base enough to entrap
me, now are preparing to destroy me because they are
cowardly enough to be afraid of me while I am alive.
Yes, trapped, exiled, utterly discredited as I am to-day,
they are still afraid of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, Thessa?&#8221; he asked, deeply disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am what you first saw me&mdash;a dancer, Garry, and
nothing worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems strange that a European Government
should desire your destruction,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I really were what this Government believes me
to be, it would not seem strange to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat thinking, worrying her under lip with delicate
white teeth; then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, do you believe that your country is going
to be drawn into this war?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think,&#8221; he said bitterly. &#8220;The
<i>Lusitania</i> ought to have meant war between us and
Germany. Every brutal Teutonic disregard of decency
since then ought to have meant war&mdash;every unarmed
ship sunk by their U-boats, every outrage in
America perpetrated by their spies and agents ought
to have meant war. I don&#8217;t know how much more this
Administration will force us to endure&mdash;what further
flagrant insult Germany means to offer. They&#8217;ve answered
the President&#8217;s last note by canning Von Tirpitz
and promising, conditionally, to sink no more unarmed
ships without warning. But they all are liars,
the Huns. So that&#8217;s the way matters stand, Thessa,
and I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea of what is going to happen
to my humiliated country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does not your country prepare?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows why. Washington doesn&#8217;t believe in it,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should build ships,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You should
prepare plans for calling out your young men.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded indifferently:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a preparedness parade. I marched in
it. But it only irritated Washington. Now, finally,
the latest Mexican insult is penetrating official stupidity,
and we are mobilising our State Guardsmen for
service on the border. And that&#8217;s about all we are
doing. We are making neither guns nor rifles; we
are building no ships; the increase in our regular army
is of little account; some of the most vital of the great

national departments are presided over by rogues,
clowns, and fools&mdash;pacifists all!&mdash;stupid, dull, grotesque
and impotent. And you ask me what my country
is going to do. And I tell you that I don&#8217;t know.
For real Americans, Thessa, these last two years have
been years of shame. For we should have armed and
mobilised when the first rifle-shot cracked across the
Belgian frontier at Longwy; and we should have declared
war when the first Hun set his filthy hoof on
Belgian soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our hearts we real Americans know it. But we
had no leader&mdash;nobody of faith, conviction, vision, action,
to do what was the only thing to do. No; we had
only talkers to face the supreme crisis of the world&mdash;only
the shallow noise of words was heard in answer
to God&#8217;s own summons warning all mankind that hell&#8217;s
deluge was at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The intense bitterness of what he said had made her
very grave. She listened silently, intent on his every
expression. And when he ended with a gesture of
hopelessness and disgust, she sat gazing at him out
of her lovely dark eyes, deep in reflection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry,&#8221; she said at length, &#8220;do you know anything
about the European systems of intelligence?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;only what I read in novels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that America, to-day, is fairly crawling
with German spies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose there are some here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a hundred thousand paid German spies
within an hour&#8217;s journey of this city.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how it is arranged
here. The German Ambassador is the master spy in
America. Under his immediate supervision are the so-called
diplomatic agents&mdash;the personnel of the embassy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and members of the consular service. These people do
not class themselves as agents or as spies; they are
the directors of spies and agents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agents gather information from spies who perform
the direct work of investigating. Spies usually work
alone and report, through local agents, to consular
or diplomatic agents. And these, in turn, report to the
Ambassador, who reports to Berlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all directed from Berlin. The personal source
of all German espionage is the Kaiser. He is the supreme
master spy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you learned these things, Thessa?&#8221; he
asked in a troubled voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learned, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;a spy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me; just listen. There are men here in
your city who are here for no good purpose. I do
not mean to say that merely because they seek also to
injure me&mdash;destroy me, perhaps,&mdash;God knows what
they wish to do to me!&mdash;but I say it because I believe
that your country will declare war on Germany
some day very soon. And that you ought to watch
these spies who move everywhere among you!</p>
<p>&#8220;Germany also believes that war is near. And this
is why she strives to embroil your country with Japan
and Mexico. That is why she discredits you with Holland,
with Sweden. It is why she instructs her spies
here to set fires in factories and on ships, blow up
powder mills and great industrial plants which are
manufacturing munitions for the Allies of the Triple
Entente.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&#8220;America may doubt that there is to be war between
her and Germany, but Germany does not doubt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you what else Germany is doing. She
is spreading insidious propaganda through a million
disloyal Germans and pacifist Americans, striving to
poison the minds of your people against England. She
secretly buys, owns, controls newspapers which are
used as vehicles for that propaganda.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is debauching the Irish here who are discontented
with England&#8217;s rule; she spends vast sums of
money in teaching treachery in your schools, in arousing
suspicion among farmers, in subsidising mercantile
firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, I tell you that a Hun is always a Hun; a
Boche is always a Boche, call him what else you will.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Germans are the monkeys of the world; they
have imitated the human race. But, Garry, they are
still what they always have been at heart, barbarians
who have no business in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;In their hearts&mdash;and for all their priests and clergymen
and cathedrals and churches&mdash;they still believe in
their old gods which they themselves created&mdash;fierce,
bestial supermen, more cruel, more powerful, more
treacherous, more beastly than they themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the German. That is the Hun under all
his disguises. No white man can meet him on his
own ground; no white man can understand him, appeal
to anything in common between himself and the Boche.
He is brutal and contemptuous to women; he is tyrannical
to the weak, cringing to the strong, fundamentally
bestial, utterly selfish, intolerant of any civilisation
which is not his conception of civilisation&mdash;his
monkey-like conception of Christ&mdash;whom, in his pagan
soul, he secretly sneers at&mdash;not always secretly, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>She straightened up with a quick little gesture of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
contempt. Her face was brightly flushed; her eyes
brilliant with scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, has not America heard enough of &#8216;the good
German,&#8217; the &#8216;kindly Teuton,&#8217; the harmless, sentimental
and &#8216;excellent citizen,&#8217; whose morally edifying origin
as a model emigrant came out of his own sly mouth,
and who has, by his own propaganda alone, become an
accepted type of good-natured thrift and erudition in
your Republic?</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me say to you what a French girl thinks! A
hundred years ago you were a very small nation, but
you were homogeneous and the average of culture was
far higher in America then than it is at present. For
now, your people&#8217;s cultivation and civilisation is diluted
by the ignorance of millions of foreigners to
whom you have given hospitality. And, of these, the
Germans have done you the most deadly injury, vulgarising
public taste in art and literature, affronting
your clean, sane intelligence by the new decadence and
perversion in music, in painting, in illustration, in fiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the normal Hun touches he vulgarises;
whatever the decadent Boche touches he soils and degrades
and transforms into a horrible abomination.
This he has done under your eyes in art, in literature,
in architecture, in modern German music.</p>
<p>&#8220;His filthy touch is even on your domestic life&mdash;this
Barbarian who feeds grossly, whose personal habits
are a by-word among civilised and cultured people,
whose raw ferocity is being now revealed to the world
day by day in Europe, whose proverbial clumsiness and
stupidity have long furnished your stage with its oafs
and clowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the thing that is now also invading you with
thousands of spies, betraying you with millions of traitors,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
and which will one day turn on you and tear you
and trample you like an enraged hog, unless you and
your people awake to what is passing in the world you
live in!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was on her feet now, flushed, lovely, superb in
her deep and controlled excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you this much,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is Germany
that wishes my destruction. Germany trapped me;
Germany would have destroyed me in the trap had I
not escaped. Now, Germany is afraid of me, knowing
what I know. And her agents follow me, spy on
me, thwart me, prevent me from earning my living,
until I&mdash;I can scarcely endure it&mdash;this hounding and
persecution&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her voice broke; she waited to control
it:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a spy. I never was one. I never betrayed
a human soul&mdash;no, nor any living thing that
ever trusted me! These people who hound me know
that I am not guilty of that for which another Government
is ready to try me&mdash;and condemn me. They
fear that I shall prove to this other Government my
innocence. I can&#8217;t. But they fear I can. And the
Hun is afraid of me. Because, if I ever proved my innocence,
it would involve the arrest and trial and certain
execution of men high in rank in the capital of this
other country. So&mdash;the Hun dogs me everywhere I
go. I do not know why he does not try to kill me.
Possibly he lacks courage, so far. Possibly he has
not had any good opportunity, because I am very careful,
Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this&mdash;this is outrageous!&#8221; broke out Barres.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t stand this sort of thing, Thessa! It&#8217;s a
matter for the police&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interfere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interfere! The last thing I want is publicity.
The last thing I wish for is that your city, state, or
national government should notice me at all or have
any curiosity concerning me or any idea of investigating
my affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, although as soon as your country is at
war with Germany, my danger from Germany ceases,
on the other hand another very deadly danger begins
at once to threaten me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will come from a country with which your country
will be allied. And I shall be arrested here as a
<i>German</i> spy, and I shall be sent back to the country
which I am supposed to have betrayed. And there
nothing in the world could save me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;court-martial?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A brief one, Garry. And then the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Death?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>After a few moments she moved toward the door.
He went with her, picking up his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you go with me,&#8221; she said with a faint
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are involved sufficiently already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I care for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Garry. Do you wish to displease me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please! Call me a taxicab. I wish to go back
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of argument she remained smilingly firm.
Finally he rang up a taxi for her. When it signalled
he walked down stairs, through the dim hall and out
to the grilled gateway beside her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said, giving her hand. He detained
it:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have you go alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly safe, mon ami. I&#8217;ve had a delightful
time at your party&mdash;really I have. This affair
of the letter does not spoil it. I&#8217;m accustomed to similar
episodes. So now, good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to see you again soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon? Ah, I can&#8217;t tell you that, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it is convenient then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you telephone me on your safe arrival home
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you wish. You&#8217;re so sweet to me, Garry. You
always have been. Don&#8217;t worry about me. I am not
in the least apprehensive. You see I&#8217;m rather a clever
girl, and I know something about the Boche.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had your letter stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only half of it!&#8221; she retorted gaily. &#8220;She is a
gallant little thing, your friend Dulcie. Please give
her my love. As for your other friends, they were
amusing.... Mr. Mandel spoke to me about an engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you consider it? Corot Mandel is the
most important producer in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he, really? Well, if I&#8217;m not interfered with
perhaps I shall go to call on Mr. Mandel.&#8221; She began
to laugh mischievously to herself: &#8220;There was one
man there who never gave me a moment&#8217;s peace until
I promised to lunch with him at the Ritz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Westmore,&#8221; she said demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim Westmore! Well, Thessa, he&#8217;s a corker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
He&#8217;s really a splendid fellow, but look out for him!
He&#8217;s also a philanderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear. I thought he was just a sculptor and
a rather strenuous young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t knocking him,&#8221; said Barres, laughing,
&#8220;but he falls in love with every pretty woman he meets.
I&#8217;m merely warning you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Garry,&#8221; she smiled. She gave him her
hand again, pulled the rose-coloured cloak around her
bare shoulders, ran across the sidewalk to the taxi,
and whispered to the driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll telephone me when you get home?&#8221; he reminded
her, baffled but smiling.</p>
<p>She laughed and nodded. The cab wheeled out into
the street, backed, turned, and sped away eastward.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Half an hour later his telephone rang:</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m going to bed.... Tell Mr. Westmore
that I&#8217;m not at all sure I shall meet him at the Ritz
on Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he? What devotion. What faith in woman!
What a lively capacity for hope eternal! What vanity!
Well, then, tell him he may take his chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him. But I think you might make a date
with me, too, you little fraud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I will. Maybe I&#8217;ll drop in to see you unexpectedly
some morning. And don&#8217;t let me catch
<i>you</i> philandering in your studio with some pretty
woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear, Thessa.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not at all sure. And your little model, Dulcie,
is dangerously attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Piffle! She&#8217;s a kid!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure of that, either! And tell Mr.
Westmore that I <i>may</i> keep my engagement. And then
again I may not! Good-night, Garry, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Walking slowly back to extinguish the lights in the
studio before retiring to his own room for the night,
Barres noticed a piece of paper on the table under
the lamp, evidently a fragment from the torn letter.</p>
<p>The words &#8220;Ferez Bey&#8221; and &#8220;Murtagh&#8221; caught his
eye before he realised that it was not his business to
decipher the fragment.</p>
<p>So he lighted a match, held the shred of letter paper
to the flame, and let it burn between his fingers until
only a blackened cinder fell to the floor.</p>
<p>But the two names were irrevocably impressed on
his mind, and he found himself wondering who these
men might be, as he stood by his bed, undressing.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='XIV_PROBLEMS' id='XIV_PROBLEMS'></a>
<h2>XIV
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />PROBLEMS</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The weather was turning hot in New York, and
by the middle of the week the city sweltered.</p>
<p>Barres, dropping his brushes and laying
aside a dozen pictures in all stages of incompletion;
and being, otherwise, deeply bitten by the dangerously
enchanting art of Manship&mdash;dangerous as inspiration
but enchanting to gaze upon&mdash;was very busy making
out of wax a diminutive figure of the running Arethusa.</p>
<p>And Dulcie, poor child, what with being poised on
the ball of one little foot and with the other leg slung
up in a padded loop, almost perished. Perspiration
spangled her body like dew powdering a rose; sweat
glistened on the features and shoulder-bared arms of
the impassioned sculptor, even blinding him at times;
but he worked on in a sort of furious exaltation, reeking
of ill-smelling wax. And Dulcie, perfectly willing
to die at her post, thought she was going to, and finally
fainted away with an alarming thud.</p>
<p>Which brought Barres to his senses, even before she
had recovered hers; and he proclaimed a vacation for
his overworked Muse and his model, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel better, Sweetness?&#8221; he enquired, as she
opened her eyes when Selinda exchanged a wet compress
for an ice-bag.</p>
<p>Dulcie, flat on the lounge, swathed in a crash bathrobe,
replied only by a slight but reassuring flutter of
one hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>Esmé Trenor sauntered in for a gossip, wearing his
celebrated lilac-velvet jacket and Louis XV slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the devil,&#8221; he drawled, looking from Dulcie to
the Arethusa; &#8220;she&#8217;s worth more than your amateurish
statuette, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet she is. And here&#8217;s where her vacation begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Esmé turned to Dulcie, lifting his eyebrows:</p>
<p>&#8220;You go away with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea had never before entered Barres&#8217;s head.
But he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; we both need the country for a few
weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go to one of those damned artists&#8217; colonies,
I suppose,&#8221; remarked Esmé; &#8220;otherwise, washed and
unwashed would expel shrill cries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not in my own home,&#8221; returned Barres,
coolly. &#8220;I shall write my family about it to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corot Mandel dropped in, also, that morning&mdash;he
and Esmé were ever prowling uneasily around Dulcie
in these days&mdash;and he studied the Arethusa through a
foggy monocle, and he loitered about Dulcie&#8217;s couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said to Barres, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing like
dancing to recuperate from all this metropolitan pandemonium.
If you like, I can let Dulcie in on that
thing I&#8217;m putting on at Northbrook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to her,&#8221; said Barres. &#8220;It&#8217;s her vacation,
and she can do what she likes with it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Esmé interposed with characteristic impudence:</p>
<p>&#8220;Barres imitates Manship with impunity; I&#8217;d like to
have a plagiaristic try at Sorolla and Zuloaga, if Dulcie
says the word. Very agreeable job for a girl in hot
weather,&#8221; he added, looking at Dulcie, &#8220;&mdash;an easy
swimming pose in some nice cool little Adirondack
lake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Seriously,&#8221; interrupted Mandel, twirling his monocle
impatiently by its greasy string, &#8220;I mean it,
Barres.&#8221; He turned and looked at the lithely speeding
Arethusa. &#8220;If that is Dulcie, I can give her a
good part in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear, Dulcie?&#8221; enquired Barres. &#8220;These two
kind gentlemen have what they consider attractive jobs
for you. All I can offer you is liberty to tumble around
the hayfields at Foreland Farms, with my sketching
easel in the middle distance. Now, choose your job,
Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hayfields and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s voice faded to a whisper; Barres, seated beside
her, leaned nearer, bending his head to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>you</i>,&#8221; she murmured again, &#8220;&mdash;if you want
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always want you,&#8221; he whispered laughingly, in
return.</p>
<p>Esmé regarded the scene with weariness and chagrin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he said languidly to Mandel, &#8220;we&#8217;ll buy
her some flowers for the evil she does us. She&#8217;ll need
&#8217;em; she&#8217;ll be finished before this amateur sculptor finishes
his blooming Arethusa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandel lingered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up to Northbrook in a day or two,
Barres. If you change&mdash;change Dulcie&#8217;s mind for her,
just call me up at the Adolf Gerhardt&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie will call you up if she changes my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie laughed.</p>
<p>When they had gone, Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I haven&#8217;t thought about the summer.
What was your idea about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;d want a couple of weeks in the country
somewhere, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I never went away,&#8221; she replied
vaguely.</p>
<p>It occurred to him, now, that for all his pleasant
toleration of Soane&#8217;s little daughter during the two
years and more of his residence in Dragon Court, he
had never really interested himself in her well-being,
never thought to enquire about anything which might
really concern her. He had taken it for granted that
most people have some change from the stifling, grinding,
endless routine of their lives&mdash;some respite, some
quiet interval for recovery and rest.</p>
<p>And so, returning from his own vacations, it never
occurred to him that the shy girl whom he permitted
within his precincts, when convenient, never knew any
other break in the grey monotony&mdash;never left the dusty,
soiled, and superheated city from one year&#8217;s summer
to another.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, he realised it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go up there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My family is accustomed
to models I bring there for my summer work.
You&#8217;ll be very comfortable, and you&#8217;ll feel quite at
home. We live very simply at Foreland Farms. Everybody
will be kind and nobody will bother you, and you
can do exactly as you please, because we all do that at
Foreland Farms. Will you come when I&#8217;m ready to
go up?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a sweet, confused glance from her grey
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think your family would mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind?&#8221; He smiled. &#8220;We never interfere with one
another&#8217;s affairs. It&#8217;s not like many families, I fancy.
We take it for granted that nobody in the family could
do anything not entirely right. So we take that for
granted and it&#8217;s a jolly sensible arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her face on the pillow presently; the ice-bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
slid off; she sat up in her bathrobe, stretched her
arms, smiled faintly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I try again?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; he said, &#8220;<i>would</i> you? Upon my word,
I believe you would! No more posing to-day! I&#8217;m not
a murderer. Lie there until you&#8217;re ready to dress, and
then ring for Selinda.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I want you alive, not dead! Anyway,
I&#8217;ve got to talk to Westmore this morning, so you may
be as lazy as you like&mdash;lounge about, read&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
went over to her, patted her cheek in the smiling, absent-minded
way he had with her: &#8220;Tell me, ducky,
how are you feeling, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>It confused her dreadfully to blush when he touched
her, but she always did; and she turned her face away
now, saying that she was quite all right again.</p>
<p>Preoccupied with his own thoughts, he nodded:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now, trot along to Selinda,
and when you&#8217;re fixed up you can have the run
of the place to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I have my slippers?&#8221; She was very shy
even about her bare feet when she was not actually
posing.</p>
<p>He found her slippers for her, laid them beside the
lounge, and strolled away. Westmore rang a moment
later, but when he blew in like a noisy breeze Dulcie
<ins title='Was has'>had</ins> disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;My little model toppled over,&#8221; said Barres, taking
his visitor&#8217;s outstretched hand and wincing under the
grip. &#8220;I shall cut out work while this weather lasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore turned toward the Arethusa, laughed at
the visible influence of Manship.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same, Garry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a lot in
your running nymph. It&#8217;s nice; it&#8217;s knowing.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is pleasant to hear from a sculptor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sculptor? Sometimes I feel like a sculpin&mdash;prickly
heat, you know.&#8221; He laughed heartily at his own
witticism, slapped Barres on the shoulder, lighted a
pipe, and flung himself on the couch recently vacated
by Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;This damned war,&#8221; he said, &#8220;takes the native gaiety
out of a man&mdash;takes the laughter out of life. Over two
years of it now, Garry; and it&#8217;s as though the sun is
slowly growing dimmer every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; nodded Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you feel it. Everybody does. By God, I have
periods of sickness when the illustrated London periodicals
arrive, and I see those dead men pictured there&mdash;such
fine, clean fellows&mdash;our own kind&mdash;half of them
just kids!&mdash;well, it hurts me to look at them, and, for
the sheer pain of it, I&#8217;m always inclined to shirk and
turn that page quickly. But I say to myself, &#8216;Jim,
they&#8217;re dead fighting Christ&#8217;s own battle, and the least
you can do is to read their names and ages, and look
upon their faces.&#8217;... And I do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; nodded Barres, sombrely gazing at the
carpet.</p>
<p>After a silence, Westmore said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the Boche has taken his medicine and canned
Tirpitz&mdash;the wild swine that he is. So I don&#8217;t suppose
we&#8217;ll get mixed up in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hun is a great liar,&#8221; remarked Barres.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to Plattsburg again this year?&#8221; enquired
Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the autumn, perhaps.... Garry, it&#8217;s discouraging.
Do you realise what a gigantic task we have
ahead of us if the Hun ever succeeds in kicking us into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
this war? And what a gigantic mess we&#8217;ve made of
two years&#8217; inactivity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, pondering, scowled at his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued the other, &#8220;the Guard is off
to the border, and here we are, stripped clean, with
the city lousy with Germans and every species of Hun
deviltry hatching out fires and explosions and disloyal
propaganda from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the
Lakes to the Gulf!</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine mess!&mdash;no troops, nothing to arm them with,
no modern artillery, no preparations; the Boche growing
more insolent, more murderous, but slyer; a row
on with Mexico, another brewing with Japan, all Europe
and Great Britain regarding us with contempt&mdash;I
ask you, can you beat it, Garry? Are there any
lower depths for us?&mdash;any sub-cellars of iniquity into
which we can tumble, like the basket of jelly-fish we
seem to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nightmare,&#8221; said Barres. &#8220;Since Liège and
the <i>Lusitania</i>, it&#8217;s been a bad dream getting worse.
We&#8217;ll have to wake, you know. If we don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re of
no more substance than the dream itself:&mdash;we <i>are</i> the
dream, and we&#8217;ll end like one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to wait a bit longer,&#8221; said Westmore
restlessly, &#8220;and if there&#8217;s nothing doing, it&#8217;s me for
the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, too, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a bargain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.... I&#8217;d rather go under my own flag,
of course.... We&#8217;ll see how this Boche backdown
turns out. I don&#8217;t think it will last. I believe the Huns
have been stirring up the Mexicans. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise
me if they were at the bottom of the Japanese
menace. But what angers me is to think that we have
received with innocent hospitality these hundreds of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
thousands of Huns in America, and that now, all over
the land, this vast, acclimated nest of snakes rises hissing
at us, menacing us with their filthy fangs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God our police is still half Irish,&#8221; growled
Westmore, puffing at his pipe. &#8220;These dirty swine
might try to rush the city if war comes while the Guard
is away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing enough damage as it is,&#8221; said Barres,
&#8220;with their traitorous press, their pacifists, their
agents everywhere inciting labour to strike, teaching
disorganisation, combining commercially, directing
blackmail, bomb outrages, incendiaries, and infesting
the Republic with a plague of spies&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The studio bell rang sharply. Barres, who stood
near the door, opened it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa!&#8221; he exclaimed, astonished and delighted.</p>

<h2>XV
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />BLACKMAIL</span></h2>
</div>
<p>She came in swiftly, stirring the sultry stillness
of the studio with a little breeze from her gown,
faintly fragrant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, dear!&mdash;&#8221; She gave him both her hands and
looked at him; and he saw the pink tint of excitement
in her cheeks and her dark eyes brilliant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa, this is charming of you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I came&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She cast a swift glance around
her, beheld Westmore, gave him one hand as he came
forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she said, almost breathlessly,
plainly controlling some inward excitement.</p>
<p>But Westmore retained her hand and laid the other
over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>said</i> you&#8217;d come to the Ritz&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.... I have been&mdash;bothered&mdash;with matters&mdash;affairs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are bothered now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you have
something to say to Garry, I&#8217;ll go about my business....
Only I&#8217;m sorry it&#8217;s not your business, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He released her hand and reached for the door-knob:
her dark eyes were resting on him with a strained, intent
expression. On impulse she thrust out her arm
and closed the door, which he had begun to open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;Mr. Westmore.... I do want to see you.
I&#8217;m trying to think clearly&mdash;&#8221; She turned and looked
at Barres.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is it serious?&#8221; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;suppose so.... Garry, I wish to&mdash;to come
here ... and stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he replied pleasantly, bewildered and
almost inclined to laugh.</p>
<p>She said in a low, tense voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really in trouble, Garry. I told you once that
the word was not in my vocabulary.... I&#8217;ve had to
include it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry! Tell me all about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked himself: she turned to Westmore&mdash;a
deeper flush came into her cheeks&mdash;then she said
gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely know Mr. Westmore, but if he is like
you, Garry&mdash;your sort&mdash;perhaps he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d do anything for you, Thessa, if you&#8217;ll let him.
Have you confidence in me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can have the same confidence in Jim. I
suggest it because I have a hazy idea what your trouble
is. And if you came to ask advice, then I think
that you&#8217;ll get double value if you include Jim Westmore
in your confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood silent and with heightened colour for a
moment, then her expression became humorous, and,
partly turning, she put out her gloved hand behind
her and took hold of Westmore&#8217;s sleeve. It was
at once an appeal and an impulsive admission of her
confidence in this young man whom she had liked from
the beginning, and who must be trustworthy because
he was the friend of Garret Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared half to death,&#8221; she remarked, without a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
quaver in her voice, but her smile had now become
forced, and a quick, uneven little sigh escaped her as
she passed her arms through Barres&#8217; and Westmore&#8217;s,
and, moving across the carpet between them, suffered
herself to be installed among the Chinese cushions upon
the lounge by the open window.</p>
<p>In her distractingly pretty summer hat and gown,
and with her white gloves and gold-mesh purse in her
lap&mdash;her fresh, engaging face and daintily rounded
figure&mdash;Thessalie Dunois seemed no more mature, no
more experienced in worldly wisdom, than the charming
young girls one passes on Fifth Avenue on a golden
morning in early spring.</p>
<p>But Westmore, looking into her dark eyes, divined,
perhaps, something less inexperienced, less happy in
their lovely, haunted depths. And, troubled by he
knew not what, he waited in silence for her to speak.</p>
<p>Barres said to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are being annoyed, Thessa, dear. I gather
that much from what has already happened. Can Jim
and I do anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.... It&#8217;s come to a point where I&mdash;I&#8217;m
afraid&mdash;to be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gaze fell; she sat brooding for a few moments,
then, with a quick intake of breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;It humiliates me to come to you. Would you believe
that of me, Garry, that it has come to a point
where I am actually afraid to be alone? I thought I
had plenty of what the world calls courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>had</i>. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s become of it&mdash;what has
happened to me.... I don&#8217;t want to tell you more
than I have to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us as much as you think necessary,&#8221; said
Barres, watching her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.... Well, then, some years ago I
earned the enmity of a man. And, through him, a
European Government blacklisted me. It was a terrible
thing. I did not fully appreciate what it meant
at the time.&#8221; She turned to Westmore in her pretty,
impulsive way: &#8220;This European Government, of which
I speak, believes me to be the agent of another foreign
government&mdash;believes that I betrayed its interests.
This man whom I offended, to punish me and to cover
his own treachery, furnished evidence which would have
convicted me of treachery and espionage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The excited colour began to dye her cheeks again;
she stretched out one arm in appeal to Westmore:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please believe me! I am no spy. I never was. I
was too young, too stupid, too innocent in such matters
to know what this man was about&mdash;that he had
very cleverly implicated me in this abhorrent matter.
Do you believe me, Mr. Westmore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do!&#8221; he said with a fervour not, perhaps,
necessary. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll be kind enough to point
out that gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Jim,&#8221; interposed Barres, nodding to Thessalie
to proceed.</p>
<p>She had been looking at Westmore, apparently much
interested in his ardour, but she came to herself when
Barres interrupted, and sat silent again as though
searching her mind concerning what further she might
say. Slowly the forced smile curved her lips again.
She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just what that enraged European
Government might have done to me had I been arrested,
because I ran away ... and came here.... But the
man whom I offended discovered where I was and never
for a day even have his agents ceased to watch me,
annoy me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>There was a quick break in her voice; she set her
lips in silence until the moment&#8217;s emotion had passed,
then, turning to Westmore with winning dignity: &#8220;I
am a dancer and singer&mdash;an entertainer of sorts, by
profession. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Westmore a little more, Thessa,&#8221; said Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him. Miss Dunois was the most celebrated
entertainer in Europe when this happened. Since she
came here the man she has mentioned has, somehow,
managed to interfere and spoil every business arrangement
which she has attempted.&#8221; He looked at Thessa.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether, if Thessalie had cared to use
the name under which she was known all over Europe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare, Garry. I thought that, if some
manager would only give me a chance I could make a
new name for myself. But wherever I went I was
dogged, and every arrangement was spoiled.... I had
my jewels.... You remember some of them, Garry.
I gave those away&mdash;I think I told you why. <i>But</i> I
had other jewels&mdash;unset diamonds given to my mother
by Prince Haledine. Well, I sold them and invested
the money.... And my income is all I have&mdash;quite a
tiny income, Mr. Westmore, but enough. Only I could
have done very well here, I think, if I had not been
interfered with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa,&#8221; said Barres, &#8220;why not tell us both a little
more? We&#8217;re devoted to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl lifted her dark eyes, and unconsciously they
were turned to Westmore. And in that young man&#8217;s
vigorous, virile personality perhaps she recognised
something refreshing, subtlely compelling, for, still
looking at him, she began to speak quite naturally of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
things which had long been locked within her lonely
heart:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scarcely more than a child when General
Count Klingenkampf killed my father. The Grand
Duke Cyril hushed it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had several thousand roubles. I had&mdash;trouble
with the Grand Duke.... He annoyed me ... as
some men annoy a woman.... And when I put him
in his place he insulted the memory of my mother because
she was a Georgian.... I slapped his face with
a whip.... And then I had to run away.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew a quick, uneven breath, smiling at Westmore
from whose intent gaze her own dark eyes never
wandered.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father had been a French officer before he took
service in Russia,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was educated in Alsace
and then in England. Then my father sent for me and
I returned to St. Peters&mdash;I mean Petrograd. And because
I loved dancing my father obtained permission
for me to study at the Imperial school. Also, I had
it in me to sing, and I had excellent instruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;And because I did such things in my own way,
sometimes my father permitted me to entertain at the
gay gatherings patronised by the Grand Duke Cyril.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled in reminiscence, and her gaze became remote
for a moment. Then, coming back, she lifted her
eyes once more to Westmore&#8217;s:</p>
<p>&#8220;I ran away from Cyril and went to Constantinople,
where Von-der-Goltz Pasha and others whom I had met
at the Grand Duke&#8217;s parties, when little more than a
child, were stationed. I entertained at the German
Embassy, and at the Yildiz Palace.... I was successful.
And my success brought me opportunities&mdash;of
the wrong kind. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she continued, with a slight movement of disdain,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t quite see how I was to get to Paris all
alone and begin a serious career. And one evening I
entertained at the German Embassy&mdash;tell me, do you
know Constantinople?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is nothing except a vast mass of gossip
and intrigue. One breakfasts on rumours, lunches on
secrets, and dines on scandals. And my maid told me
enough that day to make certain matters quite clear
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I entertained at the Embassy.... Afterward
it was no surprise when his Excellency whispered
to me that an honest career was assured me if I chose,
and that I might be honestly launched in Paris without
paying the price which I would not pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Later I was not surprised, either, when Ferez Bey,
a friend of my father, and a man I had known since
childhood, presented me to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She glanced at
Barres; he nodded; she concluded to name the man:
&#8220;&mdash;the Count d&#8217;Eblis, a Senator of France, and owner
of the newspaper called <i>Le Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a silence she stole another glance at Barres; a
smile hovered on her lips. He, also, smiled; for he,
too, was thinking of that moonlit way they travelled
together on a night in June so long ago.</p>
<p>Her glance asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it necessary to tell Mr. Westmore this?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head very slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she went on, her eyes reverting again to
Westmore, &#8220;the Count d&#8217;Eblis, it appeared, had fallen
in love with me at first sight.... In the beginning he
misunderstood me.... When he realised that I would
endure no nonsense from any man he proved to be
sufficiently infatuated with me to offer me marriage.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>She shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;At that age one man resembled another to me.
Marriage was a convention, a desirable business arrangement.
The Count was in a position to launch
me into a career. Careers begin in Paris. And I knew
enough to realise that a girl has to pay in one way or
another for such an opportunity. So I said that I
would marry him if I came to care enough for him.
Which merely meant that if he were ordinarily polite
and considerate and companionable I would ultimately
become his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the arrangement. And it caused much
trouble. Because I was a&mdash;&#8221; she smiled at Barres,
&#8220;&mdash;a success from the first moment. And d&#8217;Eblis immediately
began to be abominably jealous and unreasonable.
Again and again he broke his promise and
tried to interfere with my career. He annoyed me constantly
by coming to my hotel at inopportune moments;
he made silly scenes if I ventured to have any
friends or if I spoke twice to the same man; he distrusted
me&mdash;he and Ferez Bey, who had taken service
with him. Together they humiliated me, made my life
miserable by their distrust.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warned d&#8217;Eblis that his absurd jealousy and unkindness
would not advance him in my interest. And
for a while he seemed to become more reasonable. In
fact, he apparently became sane again, and I had even
consented to our betrothal, when, by accident, I discovered
that he and Ferez were having me followed
everywhere I went. And that very night was to have
been a gay one&mdash;a party in honour of our betrothal&mdash;the
night I discovered what he and Ferez had been doing
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so hurt, so incensed, that&mdash;&#8221; She cast an involuntary
glance at Barres; he made a slight movement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
of negation, and she concluded her sentence calmly:
&#8220;&mdash;I quarrelled with d&#8217;Eblis.... There was a very
dreadful scene. And it transpired that he had sold a
preponderating interest in <i>Le Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i> to Ferez
Bey, who was operating the paper in German interests
through orders directly from Berlin. And d&#8217;Eblis
thought I knew this and that I meant to threaten him,
perhaps blackmail him, to shield some mythical lover
with whom, he declared, I had become involved, and
who was betraying him to the British Ambassador.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew a deep, long breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it necessary for me to say that there was not a
particle of truth in his hysterical accusations?&mdash;that
I was utterly astounded? But my amazement became
anger and then sheer terror when I learned from his
own lips that he had cunningly involved me in his transactions
with Ferez and with Berlin. So cunningly, so
cleverly, so seriously had he managed to compromise
me as a German agent that he had a mass of evidence
against me sufficient to have had me court-martialled
and shot had it been in time of war.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me the situation seemed hopeless. I never would
be believed by the French Government. Horror of arrest
overwhelmed me. In a panic I took my unset
jewels and fled to Belgium. And then I came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, trembling a little at the memory of it
all. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;The agents of d&#8217;Eblis and Ferez discovered me and
have given me no peace. I do not appeal to the police
because that would stir up secret agents of the French
Government. But it has come now to a place where&mdash;where
I don&#8217;t know what to do.... And so&mdash;being
afraid at last&mdash;I am here to&mdash;to ask&mdash;advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited to control her voice, then opened her
gold-mesh bag and drew from it a letter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Three weeks ago I received this,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
ignored it. Two weeks ago, as I opened the door of
my room to go out, a shot was fired at me, and I heard
somebody running down stairs.... I was badly
scared. But I went out and did my shopping, and
then I went to the writing room of a hotel and wrote
to Garry.... Somebody watching me must have seen
me write it, because an attempt was made to steal the
letter. A man wearing a handkerchief over his face
tried to snatch it out of the hands of Dulcie Soane.
But he got only half of the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when I got home that same evening I found
that my room had been ransacked.... That was why
I did not go to meet you at the Ritz; I was too upset.
Besides, I was busy moving my quarters.... But it
was no use. Last night I was awakened by hearing
somebody working at the lock of my bedroom. And I
sat up till morning with a pistol in my hand.... And&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think I had better live entirely alone&mdash;until
it is safer. Do you, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think not!&#8221; said Westmore, turning red
with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you wish us to see that letter?&#8221; asked Barres.</p>
<p>She handed it to him. It was typewritten; and he
read it aloud, leisurely and very distinctly, pausing
now and then to give full weight to some particularly
significant and sinister sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Mademoiselle</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;For two years and more it has been repeatedly intimated
to you that your presence in America is not desirable to
certain people, except under certain conditions, which conditions
you refuse to consider.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have impudently ignored these intimations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you are beginning to meddle. Therefore, this
warning is sent to you: <i>Mind your business and cease
your meddling!</i></p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, you are invited to leave the United States
at your early convenience.</p>
<p>&#8220;France, England, Russia, and Italy are closed to you.
Without doubt you understand that. Also, doubtless you
have no desire to venture into Germany, Austria, Bulgaria,
or Turkey. Scandinavia remains open to you, and practically
no other country except Spain, because we do not
permit you to go to Mexico or to Central or South America.
Do you comprehend? <i>We</i> do not permit it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, hold your tongue and control your <i>furor
scribendi</i> while in New York. And make arrangements
to take the next Danish steamer for Christiania.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a friendly warning. For if you are still here
in the United States two weeks after you have received
this letter, other measures will be taken in your regard
which will effectually dispose of your troublesome presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The necessity which forces us to radical action in this
affair is regrettable, but entirely your own fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have, from time to time during the last two years,
received from us overtures of an amicable nature. You
have been approached with discretion and have been offered
every necessary guarantee to cover an understanding
with us.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have treated our advances with frivolity and contempt.
And what have you gained by your defiance?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our patience and good nature has reached its limits.
We shall ask nothing further of you; we deliver you our
orders hereafter. And our orders are to leave New York
immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, even now, at the eleventh hour, it may not be too
late for us to come to some understanding if you change
your attitude entirely and show a proper willingness to
negotiate with us in all good faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that must be accomplished within the two weeks&#8217;
grace given you before you depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how to proceed. If you try to play us false
you had better not have been born. If you deal honestly
with us your troubles are over.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is final.</p>

<h2>XVI
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE WATCHER</span></h2>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The Watcher,&#8221; repeated Barres, studying the
typewritten signature for a moment longer.
Then he looked at Westmore: &#8220;What do you
think of that, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore, naturally short tempered, became very
red, got to his feet, and began striding about the studio
as though some sudden blaze of inward anger were
driving him into violent motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing to do,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is to catch this
&#8216;Watcher&#8217; fellow and beat him up. That&#8217;s the way to
deal with blackmailers&mdash;catch &#8217;em and beat &#8217;em up&mdash;vermin
of this sort&mdash;this blackmailing fraternity!&mdash;I
haven&#8217;t anything to do; I&#8217;ll take the job!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better talk it over first,&#8221; suggested Barres.
&#8220;There seem to be several ways of going about it. One
way, of course, is to turn detective and follow Thessa
around town. And, as you say, spot any man who
dogs her and beat him up very thoroughly. That&#8217;s
your way, Jim. But Thessa, unfortunately, doesn&#8217;t
desire to be featured, and you can&#8217;t go about beating
up people in the streets of New York without inviting
publicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore came back and stood near Thessalie, who
looked up at him from her seat on the Chinese couch
with visible interest:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Westmore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Garry is quite right about the way I feel. I don&#8217;t
want notoriety. I can&#8217;t afford it. It would mean
stirring up every French Government agent here in
New York. And if America should ever declare war
on Germany and become an ally of France, then your
own Secret Service here would instantly arrest me and
probably send me to France to stand trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent her pretty head, adding in a quiet voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Extradition would bring a very swift end to my
career. With the lying evidence against me and a Senator
of France to corroborate it by perjury&mdash;ask yourselves,
gentlemen, how long it would take a military
court to send me to the parade in the nearest caserne!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean they&#8217;d shoot you?&#8221; demanded Westmore,
aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any court-martial to-day would turn me over to a
firing squad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Barres, turning to Westmore, &#8220;this
is a much more serious matter than a case of ordinary
blackmail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not go to our own Secret Service authorities
and lay the entire business before them?&#8221; asked Westmore
excitedly.</p>
<p>But Thessalie shook her head:</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence against me in Paris is overwhelming.
My dossier alone, as it now stands, would surely condemn
me without corroborative evidence. Your people
here would never believe in me if the French Government
forwarded to them a copy of my dossier from the
secret archives in Paris. As for my own Government&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She merely shrugged.</p>
<p>Barres, much troubled, glanced from Thessalie to
Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a rotten situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There
must be, of course, some sensible way to tackle it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
though I don&#8217;t quite see it yet. But one thing is very
plain to me: Thessa ought to remain here with us for
the present. Don&#8217;t you think so, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I, Garry?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You have only
one room, and I couldn&#8217;t turn you out&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can arrange that,&#8221; interposed Westmore, turning
eagerly to Barres with a significant gesture toward
the door at the end of the studio. &#8220;There&#8217;s the solution,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; agreed Barres; and to Thessalie, in explanation:
&#8220;Westmore&#8217;s two bedrooms adjoin my
studio&mdash;beyond that wall. We have merely to unlock
those folding doors and throw his apartment into mine,
making one long suite of rooms. Then you may have
my room and I&#8217;ll take his spare room.&#8221;</p>
<p>She still hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very grateful, Garry, and I admit that I am
becoming almost afraid to remain entirely alone,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send for your effects,&#8221; he insisted cheerfully.
&#8220;Aristocrates will move my stuff into Westmore&#8217;s spare
room. Then you shall take my quarters and be comfortable
and well guarded with Aristocrates and Selinda
on one side of you, and Jim and myself just across
the studio.&#8221; He cast a sombre glance at Westmore:
&#8220;I suppose those rats will ultimately trail her to this
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore turned to Thessalie:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your effects?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She smiled forlornly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave up my lodgings this morning, packed everything,
and came here, rather scared.&#8221; A little flush
came over her face and she lifted her dark eyes and
met Westmore&#8217;s intent gaze. &#8220;You are very kind,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;My trunks are at the Grand Central Station&mdash;if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
you desire to make up my disconcerted mind for
me. Do you really want me to come here and stay a
few days?&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore suppressed himself no longer:</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t <i>let</i> you go!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried sick
about you!&#8221; And to Barres, who sat slightly amazed
at his friend&#8217;s warmth:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose any of those dirty dogs have traced
the trunks?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never yet been able to conceal anything from
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably, then,&#8221; said Barres, &#8220;they have traced
your luggage and are watching it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your checks, anyway,&#8221; said Westmore.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once and get your baggage and bring it
here. If they&#8217;re watching for you it will jolt them to
see a man on the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres nodded approval; Thessalie opened her purse
and handed Westmore the checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You both are so kind,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I have not
felt so sheltered, so secure in many, many months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore, extremely red again, controlled his emotions&mdash;whatever
they were&mdash;with a visible effort:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry for one moment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Garry
and I are going to settle this outrageous business for
you. Now, I&#8217;m off to find your trunks. And if you
could give me a description of any of these fellows
who follow you about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;you are not to beat up anybody!&#8221; she reminded
him, with a troubled smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember. I promise you not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of them is a tall, bony, one-eyed man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
who has been hanging around here pretending to peddle
artists&#8217; materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie made a quick gesture of assent and of caution:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! His name is Max Freund. I have found it
impossible to conceal my whereabouts from him. This
man, with only one eye, appears to be a friend of the
superintendent, Soane. I am not certain that Soane
himself is employed by this gang of blackmailers, but
I believe that his one-eyed friend may pay him for any
scraps of information concerning me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we had better keep an eye on Soane,&#8221; growled
Westmore. &#8220;He&#8217;s no good; he&#8217;ll take graft from anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is his daughter, Dulcie?&#8221; asked Thessalie.
&#8220;Is she not your model, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s in my room now, lying down. This
morning it was pretty hot in here, and Dulcie fainted
on the model stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor child!&#8221; exclaimed Thessalie impulsively.
&#8220;Could I go in and see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, if you like,&#8221; he replied, surprised at her
warm-hearted interest. He added, as Thessalie rose:
&#8220;She is really all right again. But go in if you like.
And you might tell Dulcie she can have her lunch in
there if she wants it; but if she&#8217;s going to dress she
ought to be about it, because it&#8217;s getting on toward
the luncheon hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Thessalie went swiftly away down the corridor to
knock at the door of the bedroom, and Barres walked
out with Westmore as far as the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said very soberly, &#8220;this whole business
looks ugly to me. Thessa seems to be seriously entangled
in the meshes of some blackmailing spider who
is sewing her up tight.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably a tighter web than we realise,&#8221;
growled Westmore. &#8220;It looks to me as though Miss
Dunois has been caught in the main net of German
intrigue. And that the big spider in Berlin did the
spinning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s certainly what it looks like,&#8221; admitted the
other in a grave voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that this is
merely a local matter&mdash;an affair of petty, personal
vengeance: I believe that the Hun is actually afraid
of her&mdash;afraid of the evidence she might be able to
furnish against certain traitors in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore nodded gloomily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure of it, too. They&#8217;ve tried, apparently,
to win her over. They&#8217;ve tried, also, to drive
her out of this country. Now, they mean to force her
out, or perhaps kill her! Good God! Garry, did
you ever hear of such filthy impudence as this entire
German propaganda in America?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and get her trunks,&#8221; said Barres, deeply worried.
&#8220;By the time you fetch &#8217;em back here, lunch will
be ready. Afterward, we&#8217;d all better get together and
talk over this unpleasant situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore glanced at his watch, turned and went
swinging away in his quick, energetic stride. Barres
walked slowly back to the studio.</p>
<p>There was nobody there. Thessalie had not yet returned
from her visit to Dulcie Soane.</p>
<p>The Prophet, however, came in presently, his tail
politely hoisted. An agreeable aroma from the kitchen
had doubtless allured him; he made an amicable remark
to Barres, suffered himself to be caressed, then
sprang to the carved table&mdash;his favourite vantage
point for observation&mdash;and gazed solemnly toward the
dining-room.</p>
<p>For half an hour or more, Barres fussed and pottered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
about in the rather aimless manner of all artists,
shifting canvases and stacking them against the wall,
twirling his wax Arethusa around to inspect her from
every possible and impossible angle, using clouds of
fixitive on such charcoal studies as required it, scraping
away meditatively at a too long neglected palette.</p>
<p>He was already frankly concerned about Thessalie,
and the more he considered her situation the keener
grew his apprehension.</p>
<p>Yet he, like all his fellow Americans, had not yet
actually persuaded himself to believe in spies.</p>
<p>Of course he read about them and their machinations
in the daily papers; the spy scare was already well
developed in New York; yet, to him and to the great
majority of his fellow countrymen, people who made a
profession of such a dramatic business seemed unreal&mdash;abstract
types, not concrete examples of the human
race&mdash;and he could not believe in them&mdash;could neither
visualise such people nor realise that they existed outside
melodrama or the covers of a best-seller.</p>
<p>There is an incredulity which knows yet refuses to
believe in its own knowledge. It is very American and
it represented the paradoxical state of mind of this
deeply worried young man, as he stood there in the
studio, scraping away mechanically at his crusted
palette.</p>
<p>Then, as he turned to lay it aside, through the open
studio door he saw a strange, bespectacled man looking
in at him intently.</p>
<p>An unpleasant shock passed through him, and his
instinct started him toward the open door to close it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse,&#8221; said he of the thick spectacles; and Barres
stopped short:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>The man, who was well dressed and powerfully built,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
squinted through his spectacles out of little, inflamed
and pig-like eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dunois iss here?&#8221; he enquired politely. &#8220;I
haff a message&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse, please. My name iss not personally known
to Miss Dunois&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what is your business with Miss Dunois?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse, please. It iss of a delicacy&mdash;of a nature
quite private, iff you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres inspected him in hostile silence for a moment,
then came to a swift conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Step inside,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, I will wait here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Step inside!&#8221; snapped Barres.</p>
<p>Startled into silence, the man only blinked at him.
Under the other&#8217;s searching, suspicious gaze, the small,
pig-like eyes were now shifting uneasily; then, as Barres
took an abrupt step forward, the man shrank away
and stammered out something about a letter which he
was to deliver to Miss Dunois in private.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you have a letter for Miss Dunois?&#8221; demanded
Barres, now determined to get hold of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am instructed to giff it myself to her in private,
all alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am instruc&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to me, I tell you!&mdash;and come inside here!
Do you hear what I&#8217;m saying to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The spectacled man lost most of his colour as Barres
started toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse!&#8221; he faltered, backing off down the corridor.
&#8220;I giff you the letter!&#8221; And he hastily thrust
his hand into the side pocket of his coat. But it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
a pistol he poked under the other&#8217;s nose&mdash;a shiny,
lumpy weapon, clutched most unsteadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up and turn me once around your back!&#8221;
whispered the man hoarsely. &#8220;Quick!&mdash;or I shoot
you!&#8221;&mdash;as the other, astounded, merely gazed at him.
The man had already begun to back away again, but
as Barres moved he stopped and cursed him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them up your hands!&#8221; snarled the spectacled
man, with a final oath. &#8220;Keep your distance or I kill
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres heard himself saying, in a voice not much
like his own:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do this to me and get away with it! It&#8217;s
nonsense! This sort of thing doesn&#8217;t go in New York!&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly his mind grew coldly, terrible clear:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you <i>can&#8217;t</i> get away with it!&#8221; he concluded
aloud, in the calm, natural voice of conviction. &#8220;Your
stunt is scaring women! You try to keep clear of
men&mdash;you dirty, blackmailing German crook! I&#8217;ve got
your number! You&#8217;re the &#8216;Watcher&#8217;!&mdash;you murderous
rat! You&#8217;re afraid to shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was plain that the spectacled man had not discounted
anything of this sort&mdash;plain now, to Barres,
that if, indeed, murder actually had been meant, it was
not his own murder that had been planned with that
big, blunt, silver-plated pistol, now wavering wildly before
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I blow your face off!&#8221; whispered the stranger, beginning
to back away again, and ghastly pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep out of thiss! I am not looking for you. Get
you back; step once again inside that door away!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Barres had already jumped for him, had almost
caught him, was reaching for him&mdash;when the man
hurled the pistol straight at his face. The terrific
impact of the heavy weapon striking him between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
eyes dazed him; he stumbled sideways, colliding with
the wall, and he reeled around there a second.</p>
<p>But that second&#8217;s leeway was enough for the bespectacled
stranger. He turned and ran like a deer.
And when Barres reached the staircase the whitewashed
hall below was still echoing with the slam of
the street grille.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he hurried down, but found the desk-chair
empty and Soane nowhere visible, and continued
on to the outer door, more or less confused by the
terrific blow on the head.</p>
<p>Of course the bespectacled man had disappeared
amid the noonday foot-farers now crowding both sidewalks
east and west, on their way to lunch.</p>
<p>Barres walked slowly back to the desk, still dazed,
but now thoroughly enraged and painfully conscious
of a heavy swelling where the blow had fallen on his
forehead.</p>
<p>In the superintendent&#8217;s quarters he found Soane,
evidently just awakened after a sodden night at Grogan&#8217;s,
trying to dress.</p>
<p>Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nobody at the desk. Either you or Miss
Kurtz should be on duty. That is the rule. Now, I&#8217;m
going to tell you something: If I ever again find that
desk without anybody behind it, I shall go to the owners
of this building and tell them what sort of superintendent
you are! And maybe I&#8217;ll tell the police, also!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrah, then, Misther Barres&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all!&#8221; said Barres, turning on his heel. &#8220;Anything
more from you and you&#8217;ll find yourself in
trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he went up stairs.</p>
<p>The lumpy pistol still lay there in the corridor; he
picked it up and took it into the studio. The weapon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
was fully loaded. It seemed to be of some foreign
make&mdash;German or Austrian, he judged by the marking
which had been almost erased, deliberately obliterated,
it appeared to him.</p>
<p>He placed it in his desk, seated himself, explored his
bruises gingerly with cautious finger-tips, concluded
that the bridge of his nose was not broken, then threw
himself back in his armchair for some grim and concentrated
thinking.</p>

<h2>XVII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />A CONFERENCE</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The elegantly modulated accents of Aristocrates,
announcing the imminence of luncheon, aroused
Barres from disconcerted but wrathful reflections.</p>
<p>As he sat up and tenderly caressed his battered head,
Thessalie and Dulcie came slowly into the studio together,
their arms interlaced.</p>
<p>Both exclaimed at the sight of the young man&#8217;s
swollen face, but he checked their sympathetic enquiries
drily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bumped into something. It&#8217;s nothing. How are
you, Dulcie? All right again?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, evidently much concerned about his disfigured
forehead; so to terminate sympathetic advice
he went away to bathe his bruises in witch hazel, and
presently returned smelling strongly of that time-honoured
panacea, and with a saturated handkerchief
adorning his brow.</p>
<p>At the same time, there came a considerable thumping
and bumping from the corridor; the bell rang, and
Westmore appeared with the trunks&mdash;five of them.
These a pair of brawny expressmen rolled into the
studio and carried thence to the storeroom which separated
the bedroom and bath from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any trouble?&#8221; enquired Barres of Westmore, when
the expressmen had gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all. Nobody looked at me twice. What&#8217;s
happened to your noddle?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bumped it. Lunch is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie came over to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have included Dulcie among my confidants,&#8221; she
said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ve told her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything. And I am glad I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres was silent; Thessalie passed her arm around
Dulcie&#8217;s waist; the two men walked behind together.</p>
<p>The table was a mass of flowers, over which netted
sunlight played. Three cats assisted&mdash;the Prophet,
always dignified, blinked pleasantly from a window
ledge; the blond Houri, beside him, purred loudly. Only
Strindberg was impossible, chasing her own tail under
the patient feet of Aristocrates, or rolling over and
over beneath the table in a mindless assault upon her
own hind toes.</p>
<p>Seated there in the quiet peace and security of the
pleasant room, amid familiar things, with Aristocrates
moving noiselessly about, sunlight lacing wall and ceiling,
and the air aromatic with the scent of brilliant
flowers, Barres tried in vain to realise that murder
could throw its shadow over such a place&mdash;that its terrible
menace could have touched his threshold, even for
an instant.</p>
<p>No, it was impossible. The fellow could not have
intended murder. He was merely a blackmailer, suddenly
detected and instantly frightened, pulling a gun
in a panic, and even then failing in the courage to shoot.</p>
<p>It enraged Barres to even think about it, but he
could not bring himself to attach any darker significance
to the incident than just that&mdash;a blackmailer,
ready to display a gun, but not to use it, had come to
bully a woman; had found himself unexpectedly
trapped, and had behaved according to his kind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>Barres had meant to catch him. But he admitted
to himself that he had gone about it very unskilfully.
This added disgust to his smouldering wrath, but he
realised that he ought to tell the story.</p>
<p>And after the rather subdued luncheon was ended,
and everybody had gone out to the studio, he did tell
it, deliberately including Dulcie in his audience, because
he felt that she also ought to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is the present state of affairs,&#8221; he concluded,
lighting a cigarette and flinging one knee across
the other, &#8220;&mdash;&mdash;that my friend, Thessalie Dunois, who
came here to escape the outrageous annoyance of a
gang of blackmailers, is followed immediately and menaced
with further insult on my very threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;This thing must stop. It&#8217;s going to be stopped.
And I suggest that we discuss the matter now and decide
how it ought to be handled.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a silence, Westmore said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You had your nerve, Garry. I&#8217;m wondering what
I might have done under the muzzle of that pistol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s grey eyes had never left Barres. He encountered
her gaze now; smiled at its anxious intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a botch of it, Sweetness, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221; he said
lightly. And, to Westmore: &#8220;The moment I suspected
him he was aware of it. Then, when I tried to figure
out how to get him into the studio, it was too late.
I made a mess of it, that&#8217;s all. And it&#8217;s too bad,
Thessa, that I haven&#8217;t more sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gently shook her head:</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any sense, Garry. That man might
easily have killed you, in spite of your coolness and
courage&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He was just a rat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a corner! You couldn&#8217;t tell what he&#8217;d do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I could. He <i>didn&#8217;t</i> shoot. Moreover, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
legged it, which was exactly what I was certain he
meant to do. Don&#8217;t worry about me, Thessa; if I
didn&#8217;t have brains enough to catch him, at least I was
clever enough to know it was safe to try.&#8221; He laughed.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing of the hero about me; don&#8217;t think it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that Dulcie and I know what to call your
behaviour,&#8221; she said quietly, taking the silent girl&#8217;s
hand in hers and resting it in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure; it was bull-headed pluck,&#8221; growled Westmore.
&#8220;The drop is the drop, Garry, and you&#8217;re no
mind-reader.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Barres persisted in taking it humorously:</p>
<p>&#8220;I read that gentleman&#8217;s mind correctly, and his
character, too.&#8221; Then, to Thessalie: &#8220;You say you
don&#8217;t recognise him from my description?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry,&#8221; said Westmore impatiently, &#8220;if we&#8217;re going
to discuss various ways of putting an end to this
business, what way do you suggest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres lighted another cigarette:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking. And I haven&#8217;t a notion how to
go about it, unless we turn over the matter to the
police. But Thessa doesn&#8217;t wish publicity,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;so whatever is to be done we must do by ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie leaned forward from her seat on the lounge
by Dulcie:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t ask that of you,&#8221; she remonstrated earnestly.
&#8220;I only wanted to stay here for a little
while&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall do that too,&#8221; said Westmore, &#8220;but this
matter seems to involve something more than annoyance
and danger to you. Those miserable rascals are
Germans and they are carrying on their impudent intrigues,
regardless of American laws and probably to
the country&#8217;s detriment. How do we know what they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
are about? What else may they be up to? It seems
to me that somebody had better investigate their activities&mdash;this
one-eyed man, Freund&mdash;this handy gunman
in spectacles&mdash;and whoever it was who took a shot
at you the other day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Barres, &#8220;and you and I are going
to investigate. But how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Grogan&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a German joint now,&#8221; nodded Barres. &#8220;One
of us might drop in there and look it over. Thessa,
how do you think we ought to go about this affair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie, who sat on the sofa with Dulcie&#8217;s hand
clasped in both of hers&mdash;a new intimacy which still
surprised and pleasantly perplexed Barres&mdash;said that
she could not see that there was anything in particular
for them to do, but that she herself intended to cease
living alone for a while and refrain from going about
town unaccompanied.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly occurred to Barres that if he and
Dulcie went to Foreland Farms, Thessalie should be
invited also; otherwise, she&#8217;d be alone again, except for
the servants, and possibly Westmore. And he said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t do,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;We four ought to
remain in touch with one another for the present. If
Dulcie and I go to Foreland Farms, you must come, too,
Thessa; and you, Jim, ought to be there, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody demurred; Barres, elated at the prospect,
gave Thessalie a brief sketch of his family and their
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s room for a regiment in the house,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;and you will feel welcome and entirely at home.
I&#8217;ll write my people to-night, if it&#8217;s settled. Is it,
Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d adore it, Garry. I haven&#8217;t been in the country
since I left France.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet. I always have a wonderful time at Foreland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, this is splendid!&#8221; exclaimed Barres, delighted.
&#8220;If you disappear, Thessa, those German rats may become
discouraged and give up hounding you. Anyway,
you&#8217;ll have a quiet six weeks and a complete rest; and
by that time Jim and I ought to devise some method of
handling these vermin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody,&#8221; said Thessalie, smiling, &#8220;has asked Dulcie&#8217;s
opinion as to how this matter ought to be handled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres turned to meet Dulcie&#8217;s shy gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us what to do, Sweetness!&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;It
was stupid of me not to ask for your views.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments the girl remained silent, then,
the lovely tint deepening in her cheeks, she suggested
diffidently that the people who were annoying Thessalie
had been hired to do it by others more easy to handle,
if discovered.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then Barres struck
his palm with doubled fist:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i>,&#8221; he said with emphasis, &#8220;is the right way to
approach this business! Hired thugs can be handled
in only two ways&mdash;beat &#8217;em up or call in the police.
And we can do neither.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the men higher up&mdash;the men who inspire and
hire these rats&mdash;they can be dealt with in other ways.
You&#8217;re right, Dulcie! You&#8217;ve started us on the only
proper path!&#8221;</p>
<p>Considerably excited, now, as vague ideas crowded
in upon him, he sat smiting his knees, his brows knit
in concentrated thought, aware that they were on the
right track, but that the track was but a blind trail
so far.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>Dulcie ventured to interrupt his frowning cogitation:</p>
<p>&#8220;People of position and influence who hire men to
do unworthy things are cowards at heart. To discover
them is to end the whole matter, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re absolutely right, Sweetness! Wait! I begin
to see&mdash;to see things&mdash;see something&mdash;interesting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up at Thessalie:</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Eblis, Ferez Bey, Von-der-Goltz Pasha, Excellenz,
Berlin&mdash;all these were mixed up with this German-American
banker, Adolf Gerhardt, were they
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Gerhardt&#8217;s money, I am sure, that bought
the <i>Mot d&#8217;Ordre</i> from d&#8217;Eblis for Ferez&mdash;that is, for
Berlin,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; asked Westmore, &#8220;the New York
banker, Adolf Gerhardt, of Gerhardt, Klein &amp;
Schwartzmeyer, who has that big show place at Northbrook?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres smiled at him significantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that, Jim! If we go to
Foreland we&#8217;re certain to be asked to the Gerhardt&#8217;s!
They&#8217;re part of the Northbrook set; they&#8217;re received
everywhere. They entertain the personnel of the German
and Austrian Embassies. Probably their place,
Hohenlinden, is a hotbed of German intrigue and propaganda!
Thessa, how about you? Would you care
to risk recognition in Gerhardt&#8217;s drawing-room, and
see what information you could pick up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie&#8217;s cheeks grew bright pink, and her dark
eyes were full of dancing light:</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry, I&#8217;d adore it! I told you I had never been
a spy. And that is absolutely true. But if you think
I am sufficiently intelligent to do anything to help my
country, I&#8217;ll try. And I don&#8217;t care how I do it,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
added, with her sweet, reckless little laugh, and squeezed
Dulcie&#8217;s hand tightly between her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose Gerhardt would remember you?&#8221;
asked Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. I don&#8217;t believe anybody would
recollect me. If anybody there ever saw Nihla Quellen,
it wouldn&#8217;t worry me, because Nihla Quellen is merely
a memory if anything, and only Ferez and d&#8217;Eblis know
I am alive and here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And their hired agents,&#8221; added Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But such people would not be guests of Adolf
Gerhardt at Northbrook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez Bey might be his guest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I was never afraid of
Ferez&mdash;never! He is a jackal always. A threatening
gesture and he flees! No, I do not fear Ferez Bey,
but I think he is horribly afraid of me.... I think,
perhaps, he has orders to do me very serious harm&mdash;and
dares not. No, Ferez Bey comes sniffing around
after the fight is over. He does no fighting, not Ferez!
He slinks outside the smoke. When it clears away and
night comes he ventures forth to feed furtively on what
is left. That is Ferez&mdash;my Ferez on whom I would
not use a dog-whip&mdash;no!&mdash;merely a slight gesture&mdash;and
he is gone like a swift shadow in the dark!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fascinated by the transformation in her, the other
three sat gazing at Thessalie in silence. Her colour
was high, her dark eyes sparkled, her lips glowed. And
the superb young figure so celebrated in Europe, so
straight and virile, seemed instinct with the reckless
gaity and courage which rang out in her full-throated
laughter as she ended with a gesture and a snap of
her white fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;For my country&mdash;for France, whose generous mind
has been poisoned against me&mdash;I would do anything&mdash;anything!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
she said. &#8220;If you think, Garry, that I have
wit enough to balk d&#8217;Eblis, check Ferez, confuse the
plotters in Berlin&mdash;well, then!&mdash;I shall try. If you say
it is right, then I shall become what I never have been&mdash;a
spy!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat for a moment smiling in her flushed excitement.
Nobody spoke. Then her expression altered,
subtlely, and her dark eyes grew pensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said wistfully, &#8220;if I could serve my
country in some little way, France might believe me
loyal.... I have sometimes wished I might have a
chance to prove it. There is nothing I would not risk
if only France would come to believe in me.... But
there seemed to be no chance for me. It is death for
me to go there now, with that dossier in the secret
archives and a Senator of France to swear my life
away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like,&#8221; said Westmore, very red again, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go into the business, too, and help you nail some of
these Hun plotters. I&#8217;ve nothing better to do; I&#8217;d be
delighted to help you land a Hun or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you both, heart and soul!&#8221; said Barres.
&#8220;The whole country is rotten with Boche intrigue.
Who knows what we may uncover at Northbrook?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie rose and came over to where Barres sat, and
he reached up without turning around, and gave her
hand a friendly little squeeze.</p>
<p>She bent over beside him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I help?&#8221; she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet, Sweetness! Did you think you were being
left out?&#8221; And he drew her closer and passed one arm
absently around her as he began speaking again to
Westmore:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that we ought to stumble on something
at Northbrook worth following up, if we go about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
it circumspectly, Jim&mdash;with all that Austrian and German
Embassy gang coming and going during the summer,
and this picturesque fellow, Murtagh Skeel, being
lionised by&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s sudden start checked him and he looked up
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murtagh Skeel, the Irish poet and patriot,&#8221; he
repeated, &#8220;who wants to lead a Clan-na-Gael raid into
Canada or head a death-battalion to free Ireland.
You&#8217;ve read about him in the papers, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... I want to talk to you alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
blushed and dropped a confused little curtsey to Thessalie:
&#8220;Would you please pardon my rudeness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You darling!&#8221; said Thessalie, blowing her a swift,
gay kiss. &#8220;Go and talk to your best friend in peace!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres rose and walked away slowly beside Dulcie.
They stood still when out of earshot. She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a few of my mother&#8217;s letters.... She knew
a young man whose name was Murtagh Skeel.... He
was her dear friend. But only in secret. Because I
think her father and mother disliked him.... It
would seem so from her letters and his.... And she
was&mdash;in love with him.... And he with mother....
Then&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.... But she came to America
with father. That is all I know. Do you believe he
can be the same man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Murtagh Skeel,&#8221; repeated Barres. &#8220;It&#8217;s an unusual
name. Possibly he is the same man whom your
mother knew. I should say he might have been about
your mother&#8217;s age, Dulcie. He is a romantic figure
now&mdash;one of those dreamy, graceful, impractical
patriots&mdash;an enthusiast with one idea and that an
impossible one!&mdash;the freedom of Ireland wrenched by
force from the traditional tyrant, England.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought a moment, then:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Whatever the fault, and wherever lies the blame
for Ireland&#8217;s unrest to-day, this is no time to start rebellion.
Who strikes at England now strikes at all
Freedom in the world. Who conspires against England
to-day conspires with barbarism against civilisation.</p>
<p>&#8220;My outspoken sympathy of yesterday must remain
unspoken to-day. And if it be insisted on, then it will
surely change and become hostility. No, Dulcie; the
line of cleavage is clean: it is Light against Darkness,
Right against Might, Truth against Falsehood, and
Christ against Baal!</p>
<p>&#8220;This man, Murtagh Skeel, is a dreamer, a monomaniac,
and a dangerous fanatic, for all his winning
and cultivated personality and the personal purity of
his character.... It is an odd coincidence if he was
once your mother&#8217;s friend&mdash;and her suitor, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie stood before him, her head a trifle lowered,
listening to what he said. When he ended, she looked
up at him, then across the studio where Westmore had
taken her place on the sofa beside Thessalie. They
both seemed to be absorbed in a conversation which
interested them immensely.</p>
<p>Dulcie hesitated, then ventured to take possession
of Barres&#8217; arm:</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you and I sit down over here by ourselves?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>He smiled, always amused by her increasing confidence
and affection, and always a little touched by it,
so plainly she revealed herself, so quaintly&mdash;sometimes
very quietly and shyly, sometimes with an ardent impulse
too swift for self-conscious second thoughts which
might have checked her.</p>
<p>So they seated themselves in the carved compartments
of an ancient choir-stall and she rested one elbow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
on the partition between them and set her rounded
chin in her palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You pretty thing,&#8221; he said lightly.</p>
<p>At that she blushed and smiled in the confused way
she had when teased. And at such times she never
looked at him&mdash;never even pretended to sustain his
laughing gaze or brave out her own embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t torment you, Sweetness,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only
you ought not to let me, you know. It&#8217;s a temptation
to make you blush; you do it so prettily.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said, still smiling but vividly disconcerted
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, dear! I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m a brute and a bully.
But honestly, you ought not to let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to stop you,&#8221; she admitted, laughing.
&#8220;I could kill myself for being so silly. Why is it,
do you suppose, that I blu&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She checked herself, scarlet now, and sat motionless
with her head bent over her clenched palm, and her
lip bitten till it quivered. Perhaps a flash of sudden
insight had answered her own question before she had
even finished asking it. And the answer had left her
silent, rigid, as though not daring to move. But her
bitten lip trembled, and her breath, which had stopped,
came swiftly now, desperately controlled. But there
seemed to be no control for her violent little heart,
which was racing away and setting every pulse a faster
pace.</p>
<p>Barres, more uneasy than amused, now, and having
before this very unwillingly suspected Dulcie of an
exaggerated sentiment concerning him, inspected her
furtively and sideways.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tease you any more,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry. But you understand, Sweetness; it&#8217;s just a
friendly tease&mdash;just because we&#8217;re such good friends.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she nodded breathlessly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t notice me,
please. I don&#8217;t seem to know how to behave myself
when I&#8217;m with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense, Dulcie! You&#8217;re a wonderful comrade.
We have bully times when we&#8217;re together.
Don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, for the love of Mike! What&#8217;s a little
teasing between friends? Buck up, Sweetness, and
don&#8217;t ever let me upset you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; She turned and looked at him, laughed.
But there was a wonderful beauty in her grey eyes
and he noticed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little kiddie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your eyes are all starry
like a baby&#8217;s! You are not growing up as fast as you
think you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed again deliciously:</p>
<p>&#8220;How wise you are,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aha! So you&#8217;re joshing me, now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you very, very wise?&#8221; she asked demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I am. And I&#8217;m going to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, irreverent youngster! If you are going to
Foreland Farms with me, you will require various species
of clothes and accessories.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that she was frankly dismayed:</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t afford&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Piffle! I advance you sufficient salary. Thessalie
had better advise you in your shopping&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He hesitated,
then: &#8220;You and Thessa seem to have become
excellent friends rather suddenly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was so sweet to me,&#8221; explained Dulcie. &#8220;I
hadn&#8217;t cared for her very much&mdash;that evening of the
party&mdash;but to-day she came into your room, where I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
was lying on the bed, and she stood looking at me
for a moment and then she said, &#8216;Oh, you darling!&#8217;
and dropped on her knees and drew me into her arms....
Wasn&#8217;t that a curious thing to happen? I&mdash;I
was too surprised to speak for a minute; then the loveliest
shiver came over me and I&mdash;I cuddled up close to
her&mdash;because I had never remembered being in mother&#8217;s
arms&mdash;and it seemed wonderful&mdash;I had wanted it so&mdash;dreamed
sometimes&mdash;and awoke and cried myself to
sleep again.... She was so sweet to me.... We
talked.... She told me, finally, about the reason of
her visit to you. Then she told me about herself....
So I became her friend very quickly. And I am sure
that I am going to love her dearly.... And when
I love&#8221;&mdash;she looked steadily away from him&mdash;&#8220;I would
die to serve&mdash;my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s quiet ardour, her simplicity and candour,
attracted and interested him. Always he had seemed
to be aware, in her, of hidden forces&mdash;of something
fresh and charmingly impetuous held in leash&mdash;of controlled
impulses, restless, uneasy, bitted, curbed, and
reined in.</p>
<p>Pride, perhaps, a natural reticence in the opposite
sex&mdash;perhaps the habit of control in a girl whose childhood
had had no outlet&mdash;some of these, he concluded,
accounted for her subdued air, her restraint from demonstration.
Save for the impulsive little hand on his
arm at times, the slightest quiver of lip and voice,
there was no sign of the high-strung, fresh young force
that he vaguely divined within her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how much do you know about
the romance of your mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her grey eyes to his:</p>
<p>&#8220;What romance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, her marriage.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Was that a romance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gather, from your father, that your mother was
very much above him in station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was a gamekeeper for my grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your mother&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean her family name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fane.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent. She remained thoughtful, her chin
resting between two fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; she murmured, as though speaking to herself,
&#8220;when my father was intoxicated, he said that
Fane is my name, not Soane.... Do you know what
he meant?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.... His name is Soane, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you suppose he meant, if he meant
anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> your father, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, when he is intoxicated, he says that he
isn&#8217;t. And once he added that my name is not Soane
but Fane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you question him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He only cries when he is that way.... Or
talks about Ireland&#8217;s wrongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have asked him when he was sober. But he denied
ever saying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ask him when he&#8217;s the other way. I&mdash;well,
to be frank, Dulcie, you haven&#8217;t the slightest resemblance
to your father&mdash;not the slightest&mdash;not in any
mental or physical particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says I&#8217;m like mother.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And her name was Eileen Fane,&#8221; murmured Barres.
&#8220;She must have been beautiful, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; A bright blush stained her face, but
this time she looked steadily at Barres and neither of
them smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was in love with Murtagh Skeel,&#8221; said Dulcie.
&#8220;I wonder why she did not marry him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say her family objected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but what of that, if she loved him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even in those days he may have been a troublemaker
and revolutionist&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that matter if a girl is in love?&#8221;</p>
<p>In Dulcie&#8217;s voice there was again that breathless
tone through which something rang faintly&mdash;something
curbed back, held in restraint.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, smiling, &#8220;that if one is in love
nothing else matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing matters,&#8221; she said, half to herself. And
he looked askance at her, and looked again with
increasing curiosity.</p>
<p>Westmore called across the room:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessalie and I are going shopping! Any objections?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden and totally unexpected dart seemed to
penetrate the heart region of Garret Barres. It was
jealousy and it hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No objection at all,&#8221; he said, wondering how the
devil Westmore had become so familiar with her name
in such a very brief encounter.</p>
<p>Thessalie rose and came over:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie, will you come with us?&#8221; she asked gaily.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a first rate idea,&#8221; said Barres, cheering up.
&#8220;Dulcie, tell her what things you have and she&#8217;ll tell
you what you need for Foreland Farms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I will,&#8221; cried Thessalie. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
perfectly adorable in a most economical manner. Shall
we, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she held out her hand to Dulcie, and, smiling,
turned her head and looked across the room at Westmore.</p>
<p>Which troubled Barres and left him rather silent
there in the studio after they had gone away. For
he had rather fancied himself as the romance in Thessalie&#8217;s
life, and, at times, was inclined to sentimentalise
a little about her.</p>
<p>And now he permitted himself to wonder how much
there really might be to that agreeable sentiment he
entertained for, perhaps, the prettiest girl he had ever
met in his life, and, possibly, the most delightful.</p>

<h2>XVIII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE BABBLER</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The double apartment in Dragon Court, swept
by such vagrant July breezes as wandered into
the heated city, had become lively with preparations
for departure.</p>
<p>Barres fussed about, collecting sketching paraphernalia,
choosing brushes, colours, canvases, field kits,
and costumes from his accumulated store, and boxing
them for transportation to Foreland Farms, with the
languid assistance of Aristocrates.</p>
<p>Westmore had only to ship a modelling stand, a
handful of sculptors&#8217; tools, and a ton or two of Plasteline,
an evil-smelling composite clay, very useful to
work with.</p>
<p>But the storm centre of preparation revolved around
Dulcie. And Thessalie, enchanted with her new rôle
as adviser, bargainer, and purchaser, and always attaching
either Westmore or Barres to her skirts when
she and Dulcie sallied forth, was selecting and accumulating
a charming and useful little impedimenta.
For the young girl had never before owned a single
pretty thing, except those first unpremeditated gifts
of Barres&#8217;, and her happiness in these expeditions was
alloyed with trepidation at Thessalie&#8217;s extravagance,
and deep misgivings concerning her ultimate ability to
repay out of the salary allowed her as a private model.</p>
<p>Intoxicated by ownership, she watched Thessalie and
Selinda laying away in her brand-new trunk the lovely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
things which had been selected. And one day, thrilled
but bewildered, she went into the studio, where Barres
sat opening his mail, and confessed her fear that only
lifelong devotion in his service could ever liquidate her
overwhelming financial obligations to him.</p>
<p>He had begun to laugh when she opened the subject:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa is managing it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It looks like a
lot of expense, but it isn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t worry about it,
Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> worry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what a ridiculous thing to do!&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s merely advanced salary&mdash;your own
money. I told you to blow it; I&#8217;m responsible. And
I shall arrange it so you won&#8217;t notice that you are repaying
the loan. All I want you to do is to have
a good time about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am having a good time&mdash;when it doesn&#8217;t scare
me to spend so much for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you trust Thessa and me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl dropped to her knees beside his chair in
a swift passion of gratitude:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I trust you&mdash;I do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But she could not
utter another word, and only pressed her face against
his arm in the tense silence of emotions which were too
powerful to express, too deep and keen to comprehend
or to endure.</p>
<p>And she sprang to her feet, flushed, confused, turning
from him as he retained one hand and drew her
back:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child,&#8221; he said, in his pleasant voice, &#8220;this
is really a very little thing I do for you, compared to
the help you have given me by hard, unremitting, uncomplaining
physical labour and endurance. There is
no harder work than holding a pose for painter or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
sculptor&mdash;nothing more cruelly fatiguing. Add to that
your cheerfulness, your willingness, your quiet, loyal,
unobtrusive companionship&mdash;and the freshness and inspiration
and interest ever new which you always awake
in me&mdash;tell me, Sweetness, are you really in my debt,
or am I in yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in yours. You made me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always say that. It&#8217;s foolish. You made
yourself, Dulcie. You are making yourself all the
while. Why, good heavens!&mdash;if you hadn&#8217;t had it in
you, somehow, to ignore your surroundings&mdash;take the
school opportunities offered you&mdash;close your eyes and
ears to the sights and sounds and habits of what was
supposed to be your home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked himself, thinking of Soane, and his
brogue, and his ignorance and his habits.</p>
<p>&#8220;How the devil you escaped it all I can&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
he muttered to himself. &#8220;Even when I first
knew you, there was nothing resembling your&mdash;your
father about you&mdash;even if you were almost in rags!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had been with the Sisters until I went to high
school,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;It makes a difference in a
child&#8217;s mind what is said and thought by those around
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. But, Dulcie, it is usually the unfortunate
rule that the lower subtly contaminates the higher,
even in casual association&mdash;that the weaker gradually
undermines the stronger until it sinks to lesser
levels. It has not been so with you. Your clear mind
remained untarnished, your aspiration uncontaminated.
Somewhere within you had been born the quality
of recognition; and when your eyes opened on better
things you recognised them and did not forget
after they disappeared&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he ceased speaking, aware, suddenly, that for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
the first time he was making the effort to analyse this
girl for his own information. Heretofore, he had accepted
her, sometimes curious, sometimes amused, puzzled,
doubtful, even uneasy as her mind revealed itself
by degrees and her character glimmered through in
little fitful gleams from that still hidden thing, herself.</p>
<p>He began to speak again, before he knew he was
speaking&mdash;indeed, as though within him somewhere
another man were using his lips and voice as vehicles:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Dulcie, it&#8217;s not going to end&mdash;our companionship.
Your real life is all ahead of you; it&#8217;s
already beginning&mdash;the life which is properly yours to
shape and direct and make the most of.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what kind of life yours is going to
be; I know, merely, that your career doesn&#8217;t lie down
stairs in the superintendent&#8217;s lodgings. And this life
of ours here in the studio is only temporary, only a
phase of your development toward clearer aims, higher
aspiration, nobler effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tranquillity, self-respect, intelligent responsibility,
the happiness of personal independence are the prizes:
the path on which you have started leads to the only
pleasure man has ever really known&mdash;labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at her hand lying within his own,
stroked the slender fingers thoughtfully, noticing the
whiteness and fineness of them, now that they had
rested for three months from their patient martyrdom
in Soane&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to my mother and sister about it,&#8221; he concluded.
&#8220;All you need is a start in whatever you&#8217;re
going to do in life. And you bet you&#8217;re going to get it,
Sweetness!&#8221;</p>
<p>He patted her hand, laughed, and released it. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
couldn&#8217;t speak just then&mdash;she tried to as she stood
there, head averted and grey eyes brilliant with tears&mdash;but
she could not utter a sound.</p>
<p>Perhaps aware that her overcharged heart was meddling
with her voice, he merely smiled as he watched
her moving slowly back to Thessalie&#8217;s room, where the
magic trunk was being packed. Then he turned to
his letters again. One was from his mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Garry darling, anybody you bring to Foreland is always
welcome, as you know. Your family never inquires of
its members concerning any guests they may see fit to
invite. Bring Miss Dunois and Dulcie Soane, your little
model, if you like. There&#8217;s a world of room here; nobody
ever interferes with anybody else. You and your guests
have two thousand acres to roam about in, ride over, fish
over, paint over. There&#8217;s plenty for everybody to do, alone
or in company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is well. He looks little older than you.
He&#8217;s fishing most of the time, or busy reforesting that
sandy region beyond the Foreland hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sister and I ride as usual and continue to improve
the breeds of the various domestic creatures in which we
are interested and you are not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pheasants are doing well this year, and we&#8217;re beginning
to turn them out with their foster-mothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father wishes me to tell you and Jim Westmore
that the trout fishing is still fairly good, although it was
better, of course, in May and June.</p>
<p>&#8220;The usual parties and social amenities continue in
Northbrook. Everybody included in that colony seems to
have arrived, also the usual influx of guests, and there is
much entertaining, tennis, golf, dances&mdash;the invariable card
always offered there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Claire and I go enough to keep from being too completely
forgotten. Your father seldom bothers himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, the war in Europe has made us, at Foreland, disinclined
to frivolity. Others, too, of the older society in
Northbrook are more subdued than usual, devote themselves
to quieter pursuits. And those among us who have sons of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
military age are prone to take life soberly in these strange,
oppressive days when even under sunny skies in this land
aloof from war, all are conscious of the tension, the vague
foreboding, the brooding stillness that sometimes heralds
storms.</p>
<p>&#8220;But all north-country folk do not feel this way. The
Gerhardts, for example, are very gay with a house full
of guests and overflowing week-ends. The German Embassy,
as always, is well represented at Hohenlinden. Your
father won&#8217;t go there at all now. As for Claire and myself,
we await political ruptures before we indulge in social
ones. And it doesn&#8217;t look like war, now that Von Tirpitz
has been sent to Coventry.</p>
<p>&#8220;This, Garry darling, is my budget of news. Bring
your guests whenever you please. You wouldn&#8217;t bring anybody
you oughtn&#8217;t to; your family is liberal, informal,
pleasantly indifferent, and always delightfully busy with
its individual manias and fads; so come as soon as you
please&mdash;sooner, please&mdash;because, strange as it may seem,
your mother would like to see you.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter was what he had expected. But, as always,
it made him very grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful mother I have,&#8221; he murmured, opening
another letter from his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Dear Garret</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the devil don&#8217;t you come up? You&#8217;ve missed the
cream of the fishing. There&#8217;s nothing doing in the streams
now, but at sunrise and toward evening they&#8217;re breaking
nicely in the lake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve put in sixty thousand three-year transplants this
year on that sandy stretch. They are white, Scotch and
Austrian. Your children will enjoy them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dogs are doing well. There&#8217;s one youngster, the
litter-tyrant of Goldenrod&#8217;s brood, who ought to make a
field winner. But there&#8217;s no telling. You and I&#8217;ll have &#8217;em
out on native woodcock.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some grouse, but we ought to let them alone
for the next few years. As for the pheasants, they&#8217;re everywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
now, in the brake, silver-grass, and weeds, peeping,
scurrying, creeping&mdash;cunning little beggars and growing
wild as quail.</p>
<p>&#8220;The horses are all right. The crops promise well. Labour
is devilish scarce, and unsatisfactory when induced
to accept preposterous wages. What we need are coolies,
if these lazy, native slackers continue to handicap the
farmers who have to employ them. The American &#8216;hired
man&#8217;! He makes me sick. With few exceptions, he is
incredibly stupid, ignorant, unwilling, lazy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sometimes a crook, too; he takes pay for what he
doesn&#8217;t do; he steals your time; he cares absolutely nothing
about your interests or convenience; he will leave you
stranded in harvest time, without any notice at all; decent
treatment he does not appreciate; he&#8217;ll go without a warning
even, leaving your horses unfed, your cattle unwatered,
your crops rotting!</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a degenerate relic of those real men who broke
up the primæval wilderness. He is the reason for high
prices, the cause of agricultural and industrial distress,
the inert, sodden, fermenting, indigestible mass in the
belly of the body-politic!</p>
<p>&#8220;The American hired man! If the country doesn&#8217;t spew
him up, he&#8217;ll kill it!</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve heard me before on this subject, Garret.
I&#8217;m likely to air my views, you know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my son, I look forward to your arrival. I am glad
that Westmore is coming with you. As for your other
guests, they are welcome, of course.</p>

<p>He laughed; this letter so perfectly revealed his
father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad and his trout and his birds and his pines and
his eternally accursed hired help,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;Dad and his monocle and his immaculate attire&mdash;the
finest man who ever fussed!&#8221; And he laughed tenderly
to himself as he broke the seal of his sister&#8217;s brief
note:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Garry dear, I&#8217;ve been so busy schooling horses and
dancing that I&#8217;ve had no time for letter writing. So glad
you&#8217;re coming at last. Bring along any good novels you
see. My best to Jim. Your guests can be well mounted,
if they ride. Father is wild because there are more foxes
than usual, but he&#8217;s promised not to treat them as vermin,

</blockquote>
<p>Barres pocketed his sheaf of letters and began to
stroll about the studio, whistling the air of some recent
musical atrocity.</p>
<p>Westmore, in his own room, composing verses&mdash;a
secret vice unsuspected by Barres&mdash;bade him &#8220;Shut
up!&#8221;&mdash;the whistling no doubt ruining his metre.</p>
<p>But Barres, with politest intentions, forgot himself
so many times that the other man locked up his &#8220;Lines
to Thessalie when she was sewing on a button for me,&#8221;
and came into the studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; he inquired naïvely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s who?&#8221; demanded Barres, still sensitive
over the increasing intimacy of this headlong young
man and Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In there fussing with Dulcie&#8217;s togs. Go ahead in,
if you care to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your stuff packed up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres nodded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of it. How many trunks is Thessa taking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; said Barres, with a trace of irritation.
&#8220;She&#8217;s at liberty to take as many as she
likes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore didn&#8217;t notice the irritation; his mind was
entirely occupied by Thessalie&mdash;an intellectual condition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
which had recently become rather painfully apparent
to Barres, and, doubtless, equally if not painfully
apparent to Thessalie herself.</p>
<p>Probably Dulcie noticed it, too, but gave no sign,
except when the serious grey eyes stole toward Barres
at times, as though vaguely apprehensive that he might
not be entirely in sympathy with Westmore&#8217;s enchanted
state of mind.</p>
<p>As for Thessalie, though Westmore&#8217;s naïve and increasing
devotion could scarcely escape her notice, it
was utterly impossible to tell how it affected her&mdash;whether,
indeed, it made any impression at all.</p>
<p>For there seemed to be no difference in her attitude
toward these two men; it was plain enough that she
liked them both&mdash;that she believed in them implicitly,
was happy with them, tranquil now in her new security,
and deeply penetrated with gratitude for their
kindness to her in her hour of need.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Come on in,&#8221; coaxed Westmore, linking his arm
in Barres&#8217;, and counting on the latter to give him countenance.</p>
<p>The arm of Barres remained rigid and unresponsive,
but his legs were reluctantly obliging and carried
him along with Westmore to what had been his own
room before Thessalie had installed herself there.</p>
<p>And there she was on her knees, amid a riot of lingerie
and feminine effects, while Dulcie lovingly
smoothed out and folded object after object which
Selinda placed between layers of pale blue tissue paper
in the trunks.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are things going, Thessa?&#8221; inquired Westmore,
in the hearty, cheerful voice of the intruder who
hopes to be made welcome. But her attitude was discouraging.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You know you are only in the way,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Drive him out, Dulcie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie laughed and looked at them both with shyly
friendly eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my trousseau not beautiful?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;If
you&#8217;ll step outside I&#8217;ll put on a hat and gown for
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dulcie!&#8221; protested Thessalie, &#8220;I want you to
dawn upon them, and a dress rehearsal would spoil
it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore tiptoed around amid lovely, frail mounds
of fabrics, until ordered to an empty chair and forbidden
further motion. It was all the same to him, so
long as his fascinated gaze could rest on Thessalie.</p>
<p>Which further annoyed Barres, and he backed out
and walked to the studio, considerably disturbed in
his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;is making an ass of himself,
hanging around Thessa like a half-witted child.
She can&#8217;t help noticing it, but she doesn&#8217;t seem to do
anything about it. I don&#8217;t know why she doesn&#8217;t
squelch him&mdash;unless she likes it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But the idea
was so unpleasant to Barres that he instantly abandoned
that train of thought and prepared for himself
a comfortable nest on the lounge, a pipe, and an uncut
volume of flimsy summer fiction.</p>
<p>In the middle of these somewhat sullen preparations,
there came a ring at his studio door. Only the superintendent
or strangers rang that bell as a rule, and
Barres went to his desk, slipped his loaded pistol into
his coat pocket, then walked to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>Soane stood there, his face a shiny-red from drink,
his legs steady enough. As usual when drunk, he was
inclined to be garrulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; inquired Barres in a low voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wisha, Misther Barres, sorr, av ye&#8217;re not too busy
f&#8217;r to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-h-h! Don&#8217;t bellow at the top of your voice.
Wait a moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>He picked up his hat and came out into the corridor,
closing the studio door behind him so that Dulcie,
if she appeared on the scene, should not be humiliated
before the others.</p>
<p>Soane began again, but the other cut him short:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t start talking here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come down
to your own quarters if you&#8217;re going to yell your head
off!&#8221; And he led the way, impatiently, down the stairs,
past the desk where Miss Kurtz sat stolid and mottled-faced
as a lump of uncooked sausage, and into
Soane&#8217;s quarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you listen to me first!&#8221; he said when Soane
had entered and he had closed the door behind them.
&#8220;You keep out of my apartment and out of Dulcie&#8217;s
way, too, when you&#8217;re drunk! You&#8217;re not going to
last very long on this job; I can see that plainly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, sorr, you&#8217;re right! I&#8217;m fired out entirely
this blessed minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been discharged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have that, sorr!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for? Drunkenness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Th&#8217; divil do I know phwat for! Wisha, then, Misther
Barres, is there anny harrm av a man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is! I told you Grogan&#8217;s would do the
trick for you. Now you&#8217;re discharged without a reference,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane smiled airily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Misther Barres, dear, don&#8217;t lave that worrit ye!
I want no riference from anny landlord. Sure, landlords
is tyrants, too! An&#8217; phwat the divil should I
be wantin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane hooked both thumbs into the armholes of his
vest, and swaggered about the room:</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless yer kind heart, sorr, I&#8217;ve a-plenty to do
and more for good measure!&#8221; He came up to confront
Barres, and laid a mysterious finger alongside his
over-red nose and began to brag:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s thim in high places as looks afther the
likes o&#8217; me, sorr. There&#8217;s thim that thrusts me, thim
that depinds on me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you another job?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane&#8217;s scorn was superb:</p>
<p>&#8220;A job is ut? Misther Barres, dear, I was injuced
f&#8217;r to accept a <i>position</i> of grave importance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here in town?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere around tin thousand miles away or
thereabouts,&#8221; remarked Soane airily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to take Dulcie with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Musha, then, Misther Barres, &#8217;tis why I come to
ye above f&#8217;r to ax ye will ye look afther Dulcie av I
go away on me thravels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will!... Where are you going? What is
all this stuff you&#8217;re talking, anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shtuff? God be good to you, it&#8217;s no shtuff I talk,
Misther Barres! Sure, can&#8217;t a decent man thravel
f&#8217;r to see the wurruld as God made it an&#8217; no harrm
in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful what company you travel in,&#8221; said
Barres, looking at him intently. &#8220;You have been
travelling around New York in very suspicious company,
Soane. I know more about it than you think I
do. And it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if you have a run-in
with the police some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The po-lice, sorr! Arrah, then, me fut in me hand
an&#8217; me tongue in me cheek to the likes o&#8217; thim! An&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
lave them go hoppin&#8217; afther me av they like. The
po-lice is ut! Open y&#8217;r two ears, asthore, an&#8217; listen
here!&mdash;there&#8217;ll be nary po-lice, no nor constabulary,
nor excise, nor landlords the day that Ireland flies her
flag on Dublin Castle! Sure, that will be the grand
sight, with all the rats a-runnin&#8217;, an&#8217; all the hurryin&#8217;
and scurryin&#8217; an&#8217; the futther and mutther&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> are you gabbling about, Soane? What&#8217;s all
this boasting about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gabble is ut? Is it boastin&#8217; I am? Sorra the day!
An&#8217; there do be grand gintlemen and gay ladies to-day
that shall look for a roof an&#8217; a sup o&#8217; tay this day
three weeks, when th&#8217; fut o&#8217; the tyrant is lifted from
the neck of Ireland an&#8217; the landlords is runnin&#8217; for
their lives&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so!&#8221; exclaimed Barres, disgusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; phwat was ye thinkin&#8217;, sorr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That your German friends at Grogan&#8217;s are stirring
up trouble among the Irish. What&#8217;s all this nonsense,
anyway? Are they trying to persuade you to follow
the old Fenian tactics and raid Canada? Or is it an
armed expedition to the Irish coast? You&#8217;d better
be careful; they&#8217;ll only lock you up here, but it&#8217;s a
hanging matter over there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it so?&#8221; grinned Soane.</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, be aisy, Misther Barres, dear. Av
there&#8217;s hangin&#8217; to be done this time, &#8217;twill not be thim
as wears the green that hangs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres slowly shook his head:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is German work. You&#8217;re sticking your neck
into the noose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lave the noose for the Clan-na-Gael to pull, sorr,
an&#8217; &#8217;twill shqueeze no Irish neck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fool, Soane! These Germans are exploiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
such men as you. Where&#8217;s your common
sense? Can&#8217;t you see you&#8217;re playing a German game?
What do they care what becomes of you or of Ireland?
All they want is for you to annoy England at
any cost. And the cost is death! Do you dream for
an instant that you and your friends stand a ghost of
a chance if you are crazy enough to invade Canada?
Do you suppose it possible to land an expedition on
the Irish coast?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane deliberately winked at him. Then he burst
into laughter and stood rocking there on heel and toe
while his mirth lasted.</p>
<p>But the inevitable Celtic reaction presently sobered
him and switched him into a sombre recapitulation of
Erin&#8217;s wrongs. And this tragic inventory brought the
inevitable tears in time. And Woe awoke in him the
memory of the personal and pathetic.</p>
<p>The world had dealt him a wretched hand. He had
sat in a crooked game from the beginning. The cards
had been stacked; the dice were cogged. And now
he meant to make the world disgorge&mdash;pay up the living
that it owed him.</p>
<p>Barres attempted to stem the flow of volubility, but
it instantly became a torrent.</p>
<p>Nobody knew the sorrows of Ireland or of the Irish.
Tyranny had marked them for its own. As for himself&mdash;once
a broth of a boy&mdash;he had been torn from
the sacred precincts of his native shanty and consigned
to a loveless, unhappy marriage.</p>
<p>Then Barres listened without interrupting. But the
woes of Soane became vague at that point. Veiled
references to being &#8220;thrampled on,&#8221; to &#8220;th&#8217; big house,&#8221;
to &#8220;thim that was high an&#8217; shtiff-necked,&#8221; abounded in
an unconnected way. There was something about being
a servant at the fireside of his own wife&mdash;a footstool
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
on the hearth of his own home&mdash;other incomprehensible
plaints and mutterings, many scalding tears,
a blub or two, and a sort of whining silence.</p>
<p>Then Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Dulcie, Soane?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man, seated now on his bed, lifted a congested
and stupid visage as though he had not comprehended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Dulcie your daughter?&#8221; demanded Barres.</p>
<p>Soane&#8217;s blue eyes wandered wildly in an agony of
recollection:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say she was <i>not</i>, sorr?&#8221; he faltered. &#8220;Av
I told ye that, may the saints forgive me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, what was I afther sayin&#8217;, Misther&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what you said or left unsaid! I want
to ask you another question. Who was Eileen Fane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane bounded to his feet, his blue eyes ablaze:</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy Mother o&#8217; God! What have I said!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Eileen Fane your wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say her blessed name!&#8221; shouted Soane.
&#8220;Sorra the sup I tuk that loosed the tongue o&#8217; me this
cursed day! &#8217;Twas the dommed whishkey inside o&#8217; me
that told ye that&mdash;not me&mdash;not Larry Soane! Wurra
the day I said it! An&#8217; listen, now, f&#8217;r the love o&#8217; God!
Take pride to yourself, sorr, for all the goodness ye
done to Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; av I go, and I come no more to vex her, I
thank God &#8217;tis in a gintleman&#8217;s hands the child do
be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He choked; his marred hands dropped by
his side, and he stared dumbly at Barres for a moment.
Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Av I come no more, will ye guard her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will ye do fair by her, Misther Barres?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Call God to hear ye say ut!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&mdash;help me&mdash;God.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soane dropped on to the bed and took his battered
face and curly head between his <ins title='Added period'>hands.</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say no more,&#8221; he said thickly. &#8220;Nor you nor
she shall know no more. An&#8217; av ye have guessed it out,
kape it locked in. I&#8217;ll say no more.... I was good
to her&mdash;in me own way. But ye cud see&mdash;anny wan
with half a cock-eye cud see.... I was&mdash;honest&mdash;with
her mother.... She made the bargain.... I
tuk me pay an&#8217; held me tongue.... &#8217;Tis whishkey
talks, not me.... I tuk me pay an&#8217; I kept to the
bargain.... Wan year.... Then&mdash;she was dead of
it&mdash;like a flower, sorr&mdash;like the rose ye pull an&#8217; lave
lyin&#8217; in the sun.... Like that, sorr&mdash;in a year....
An&#8217; I done me best be Dulcie.... I done me best.
An&#8217; held to the bargain.... An&#8217; done me best be
Dulcie&mdash;little Dulcie&mdash;the wee baby that had come at
last&mdash;<i>her</i> baby&mdash;Dulcie Fane!...&#8221;</p>

<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />A CHANCE ENCOUNTER</span></h2>
</div>
<p>A single shaded lamp illuminated the studio,
making the shapes of things vague where outline
and colour were lost in the golden dusk.
Dulcie, alone at the piano, accompanied her own
voice with soft, scarcely heard harmonies, as she
hummed, one after another, old melodies she had learned
from the Sisters so long ago&mdash;&#8220;The Harp,&#8221; &#8220;Shandon
Bells,&#8221; &#8220;The Exile,&#8221; &#8220;Shannon Water&#8221;&mdash;songs of that
sort and period:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;<i>The Bells of Shandon,</i></p>
<p class='indent2'><i>Then sound so grand on</i></p>
<p><i>The pleasant waters of the River Lee.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>Thessalie sat by the open window and Westmore
squatted at her feet on the sill of the little balcony,
doing, as usual, all the talking while she lay deep in
her armchair waving her fan, listening, responding
with a low-voiced laugh or word now and again.</p>
<p>Dulcie sang:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;<i>On the banks of the Shannon</i></p>
<p><i>When Mary was nigh.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>From that she changed to a haunting, poignant little
song; and Barres looked up from his desk under
the lamp. Then he sealed and stamped the three letters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
which he had written to his Foreland kinfolk, and,
holding them in one hand, took his hat from the table
with the other, as though preparing to rise. Dulcie
half turned her head, her hands still idling over the
shadowy keys:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to the corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you mail your letters down stairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll step around to the branch post office; they&#8217;ll
go quicker.... What was that air you were playing
just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is called &#8216;Mea Culpa.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Play it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to the keys, recommenced the Celtic air,
and sang in a clear, childish voice:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Wake, little maid!</p>
<p>Red dawns the morn,</p>
<p>The last stars fade,</p>
<p>The day is born;</p>
<p>Now the first lark wings high in air,</p>
<p>And sings the Virgin&#8217;s praises there!</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid</p>
<p>To see the morn;</p>
<p>I lie dismayed</p>
<p>Beside the thorn.</p>
<p>Gazing at God with frightened eyes,</p>
<p>Where larks are singing in the skies.</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>II</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Why, mourn, dear maid,</p>
<p>Alone, forlorn,</p>
<p>White and afraid</p>
<p>Beside the thorn,</p>
<p>With weeping eyes and sobbing breath</p>
<p>And fair sweet face as pale as death?</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For love repayed</p>
<p>By Mary&#8217;s scorn,</p>
<p>I weep, betrayed</p>
<p>By one unborn!</p>
<p>Where can a poor lass hide her head</p>
<p>Till day be done and she be dead!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>The voice and playing lingered among the golden
shadows, hushed to a whisper, ceased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it very old, that sad little song?&#8221; he asked at
last.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother wrote it.... There is the <i>Mea Culpa</i>,
still, which ends it. Shall I sing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>So she sang the <i>Mea Culpa</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>III</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;Winds in the whinns</p>

<p class='indent3'>Till all my sins</p>
<p class='indent3'>Forgiven be&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>Maxima culpa, Lord. Amen.</i>)</p>
<p class='indent3'>And Mary&#8217;s grace my fault shall purge,</p>
<p class='indent3'>While skylarks plead my cause above,</p>
<p class='indent3'>And breezy rivers sing my dirge,</p>
<p class='indent3'>Because I loved and died of Love.</p>
<p>(<i>I love, and die of Love!</i>)</p>
<p class='indent13'>Amen.&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>When the soft cadence of the last notes was stilled,
Dulcie turned once more toward him in the uncertain
light.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very lovely,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and dreadfully triste.
The air alone is enough to break your heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother, when she wrote it, was unhappy, I
imagine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She swung slowly around to face the
keys again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you know why she was so unhappy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She fell in love,&#8221; said the girl over her shoulder.
&#8220;And it saddened her life, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat motionless for a while. Dulcie did not turn
again. Presently he rose and walked slowly out and
down stairs, carrying his letters with him.</p>
<p>The stolid, mottled-faced German girl was on duty
at the desk, and she favoured him with a sour look,
as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a gen&#8217;l&#8217;man to see you,&#8221; she mumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now. I didn&#8217;t know you was in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you ring up the apartment and
find out?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>She gave him a sullen look:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s his card,&#8221; she said, shoving it across the
desk.</p>
<p>Barres picked up the card. &#8220;Georges Renoux,
Architect,&#8221; he read. &#8220;Hotel Astor&#8221; was pencilled in
the corner.</p>
<p>Barres knit his brows, trying to evoke in his memory
a physiognomy to fit a name which seemed hazily
familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the gentleman leave any message?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, please don&#8217;t make another mistake of this
kind,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She stared at him like a sulky sow, her little eyes red
with malice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Soane?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask him,&#8221; she replied, with a slight sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to see him,&#8221; continued Barres patiently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
&#8220;Could you tell me whether he was likely to go to Grogans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Grogan&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grogan&#8217;s Café on Third Avenue&mdash;where Soane
hangs out,&#8221; he managed to explain calmly. &#8220;You
know where it is. You have called him up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it,&#8221; she grunted, resuming
the greasy novel she had been reading.</p>
<p>But when Barres, now thoroughly incensed, turned
to leave, her small, pig-like eyes peeped slyly after
him. And after he had disappeared through the corridor
into the street she hastily unhooked the transmitter
and called Grogan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Martha.... Martha Kurtz. Yes, I want
Frank Lehr.... Is that you, Frank?... The artist,
Barres, who was pumping Soane the other night,
is after him again. I told you how I listened at the
door, and how I heard that Irish souse blabbing and
bragging.... What?... Sure!... Barres was at
the desk just now inquiring if Soane had gone to Grogan&#8217;s....
You bet!... Barres is leery since <i>K17</i>
hit him with a gun. Sure; he&#8217;s stickin&#8217; his nose into
everything.... Look out for him, if he comes around
Grogan&#8217;s askin&#8217; for Soane.... And say; there was
a French guy here callin&#8217; on Barres. I knew he was
in, but I said he was out. I was just goin&#8217; to call you
when Barres came down.... Yes, I got his name....
Wait, I copied it out.... Here it is, &#8216;Georges
Renoux, Architect.&#8217; And he wrote &#8216;Hotel Astor&#8217; in
the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he said tell Barres to call him up. Naw, I
didn&#8217;t give him the message.... You don&#8217;t say! Is
that right? He&#8217;s one o&#8217; them nosey Frenchman? <i>A
captain</i>?... Gee!... What&#8217;s his lay?... In
New York? Well, you better watch out then....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Sure, I&#8217;ll ring you if he comes back!... No, there
ain&#8217;t no news.... Yes, I was to the Astor grille last
night, and I talked to <i>K17</i>.... There was a guy
higher up there. I don&#8217;t know who. He looked like
he was a dark complected Jew.... <i>Ferez Bey</i>?...
Gee!... You expect Skeel? To-night? Doin&#8217; <i>what</i>?
You think this man Renoux is watchin&#8217; the Clan-na-Gael?
Well, you better tell Soane to shut his mouth
then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that Dunois girl is here still. It&#8217;s a pity <i>K17</i>
lost his nerve.... Well, you better look out for her
and for Barres, too. They&#8217;re as thick as last year
honey!</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll let you know anything. Bye-bye.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Barres, walking leisurely up the street, kept watching
for Soane somewhere along the block; but could
see nobody in the darkness, resembling him.</p>
<p>Outdoors the July night was cooler; young girls,
hatless, in summer frocks, gathered on stoops or
strolled through the lamplit dark. Somewhere a piano
sounded, not unpleasantly.</p>
<p>In the branch post office he mailed his letters, turned
to go out, and caught sight of Soane passing along the
sidewalk just outside.</p>
<p>And with him was the one-eyed man, Max Freund&mdash;the
man who, perhaps, had robbed Dulcie of half the
letter.</p>
<p>His first emotion was sheer anger, and it started him
toward the door, bent on swift but unconsidered vengeance.</p>
<p>But before this impulse culminated in his collaring
the one-eyed man, sufficient common sense came to the
rescue. A row meant publicity, and an inquiry by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
authority would certainly involve the writer of the
partly stolen letter&mdash;Thessalie Dunois.</p>
<p>Cool and collected now, but mad all through, Barres
continued to follow Soane and Freund, dropping back
several yards to keep out of sight, and trying to make
up his mind what he ought to do.</p>
<p>The cross street was fairly well lighted; there
seemed to be plenty of evening strollers abroad, so that
he was not particularly conspicuous on the long block
between Sixth and Fifth Avenues.</p>
<p>The precious pair, arriving at Fifth Avenue, halted,
blocked by the normal rush of automobiles, unchecked
now by a traffic policeman.</p>
<p>So Barres halted, too, and drew back alongside a
shop window.</p>
<p>And, as he stopped and stepped aside, he saw a man
pause on the sidewalk across the street and move back
cautiously into the shadow of a façade opposite.</p>
<p>There was nothing significant in the occurrence;
Barres merely happened to notice it; then he turned
his eyes toward Soane and Freund, who now were crossing
Fifth Avenue. And he went after them, with no
definite idea in his head.</p>
<p>Soane and Freund walked on eastward; a tramcar
on Madison Avenue stopped them once more; and, as
Barres also halted behind them and stepped aside into
the shadows, there, just across the street, he saw the
same man again halt, retire, and stand motionless in
a recess between two shop windows.</p>
<p>Barres tried to keep one eye on him and the other
on Soane and Freund. The two latter were crossing
Madison Avenue; and as soon as they had crossed, still
headed east, the man on the other side of the street
came out of his shadowy recess and started eastward,
too.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Then Barres also started, but now he was watching
the man across the street as well as keeping Soane and
Freund in view&mdash;watching the former solitary individual
with increasing curiosity.</p>
<p>Was that man keeping an eye on him? Was he following
Soane and Freund? Was he, in fact, following
anybody, and had the lively imagination of Barres
begun to make something out of nothing?</p>
<p>At Park Avenue Freund and Soane paused, not apparently
because of any vehicular congestion impeding
their progress, but they seemed to be engaged in
vehement conversation, Soane&#8217;s excitable tones reaching
Barres, where he had halted again beside the tradesmen&#8217;s
gate of a handsome private house.</p>
<p>And once more, across the street the solitary figure
also halted and stood unstirring under a porte-cochère.</p>
<p>Barres, straining his eyes, strove to make out details
of his features and dress. And presently he concluded
that, though the man did turn and glance in his direction
occasionally, his attention was principally fixed
on Soane and Freund.</p>
<p>His movements, too, seemed to corroborate this idea,
because as soon as they started across Park Avenue
the man on the opposite side of the street was in instant
motion. And Barres, now intensely curious, walked
eastward once more, following all three.</p>
<p>At Lexington Avenue Soane sheered off and, despite
the clutch of Freund, went into a saloon. Freund
finally followed.</p>
<p>As usual, across the street the solitary figure had
stopped. Barres, also immobile, kept him in view.
Evidently he, too, was awaiting the reappearance of
Soane and Freund.</p>
<p>Suddenly Barres made up his mind to have a good
look at him. He walked to the corner, walked over to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
the south side of the street, turned west, and slowly
sauntered past the man, looking him deliberately in the
face.</p>
<p>As for the stranger, far from shrinking or avoiding
the scrutiny, he on his part betrayed a very lively
interest in the physiognomy of Barres; and as that
young man approached he found himself scanned by
a brilliant and alert pair of eyes, as keen as a fox-terrier&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In frank but subtly hostile curiosity their glances
met and crossed. Then, in an instant, a rather odd
smile glimmered in the stranger&#8217;s eyes, twitched at his
pleasant mouth, just shaded by a tiny moustache:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, sir,&#8221; he said in a low, amused voice,
&#8220;you will not&mdash;as they say in New York&mdash;butt in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, astonished, stood quite still. The young
man continued to regard him with a very intelligent
and slightly ironical expression:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whether you
are of the city police, the State service, the Post Office,
the Department of Justice, the Federal Secret
Service&#8221;&mdash;he shrugged expressive shoulders&mdash;&#8220;but this
I do know very well, that through lack of proper coordination
in the branches of all your departments of
City, State, and Federal surety, there is much bungling,
much working at cross purposes, much interference,
and many blunders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, I beg of you not to do anything further
in the matter which very evidently occupies you.&#8221;
And he bowed and glanced across at the saloon into
which Soane and Freund had disappeared.</p>
<p>Barres was thinking hard. He drew out his cigarette
case, lighted a cigarette, came to his conclusions:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are watching Freund and Soane?&#8221; he asked
bluntly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you, sir? Are you observing the stars?&#8221; inquired
the young man, evidently amused at something
or other unperceived by Barres.</p>
<p>The latter said, frankly and pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> following those two men. It is evident that
you are, also. So may I ask, have you any idea where
they are going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can guess, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Grogan&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Barres quietly, &#8220;I put myself under
your orders and go along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strange young man was much diverted:</p>
<p>&#8220;In your kind suggestion there appears to be concealed
a germ of common sense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In which
particular service are you employed, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; inquired Barres, smilingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine you may have guessed,&#8221; said the young
man, evidently greatly amused at something or other.</p>
<p>Sheer intuition prompted Barres, and he took a
chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have ventured to guess that you are an Intelligence
Officer in the French service, and secretly
on duty in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man winced but forced a very bland
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;My compliments, whether your guess is born of
certainty or not. And you, sir? May I inquire your
status?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m merely a civilian with a season&#8217;s Plattsburg
training as my only professional experience. I&#8217;m
afraid you won&#8217;t believe this, but it&#8217;s quite true. I&#8217;m
not in either Municipal, State, or Federal service.
But I don&#8217;t believe I can stand this Hun business much
longer without enlisting with the Canadians.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh. May I ask, then, why you follow that pair
yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why. I am a painter. I live at
Dragon Court. Soane, an Irishman, is superintendent
of the building. I have reason to believe that German
propagandists have been teaching him disloyalty under
promise of aiding Ireland to secure political independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming out of the branch post office this evening,
where I had taken some letters, I saw Soane and that
fellow, Freund. I really couldn&#8217;t tell you exactly
what my object was in following them, except that I
itched to beat up the German and refrained because
of the inevitable notoriety that must follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I had a vague idea of following them to
Grogan&#8217;s, where I knew they were bound, just to look
over the place and see for myself what that German
rendezvous is like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, what kept me on their trail was noticing
<i>you</i>; and your behaviour aroused my curiosity. That
is the entire truth concerning myself and this affair.
And if you believe me, and if you think I can be of
any service to you, take me along with you. If not,
then I shall certainly not interfere with whatever you
are engaged in.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments the young Intelligence Officer
looked intently at Barres, the same amused, inexplicable
smile on his face. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name,&#8221; he said, with malicious gaiety, &#8220;is
Garret Barres.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Barres completely lost countenance, but the
other man began to laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly you are Garry Barres, a painter, a celebrated
Beaux Arts man of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Barres, &#8220;<i>you</i> are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Renoux! You are little Georges Renoux, of the atelier
Ledoux!&mdash;on the architect&#8217;s side!&mdash;you are that man
who left his card for me this evening! I&#8217;ve seen you
often! You were a little devil of a nouveau!&mdash;but you
were always the centre of every bit of mischief in the
rue Bonaparte! You put the whole Quarter en charette!
I saw you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw <i>you</i>,&#8221; laughed Renoux, &#8220;on one notorious occasion,
teaching jiu-jitsu to a policeman! Don&#8217;t talk
to me about my escapades!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cordially, firmly, in grinning silence, they shook
hands. And for a moment the intervening years seemed
to melt away; the golden past became the present;
and Renoux even thrilled a little at the condescension
of Barres in shaking hands with him&mdash;the <i>nouveau</i>
honoured by the <i>ancien</i>!&mdash;the reverence never entirely
forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you, anyway, Renoux?&#8221; asked Barres,
still astonished at the encounter, but immensely interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend, you have already guessed. I am Captain:
Military Intelligence Department. You know?
There are no longer architects or butchers or bakers
in France, only soldiers. And of those soldiers I am
a very humble one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On secret duty here,&#8221; nodded Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not ask an old Beaux Arts comrade to be
discreet and loyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, France is next in my heart after
my own country. Tell me, you are following that
Irishman, Soane, and his boche friend, Max Freund,
are you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens to be as you say,&#8221; admitted Renoux,
smilingly. &#8220;A job for a &#8216;flic,&#8217; is it not?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you what I know about those two men?&mdash;what
I suspect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But at that moment
Soane came out of the saloon across the way, and
Freund followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come with you?&#8221; whispered Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you care to. Yes, come,&#8221; nodded Renoux, keeping
his clear, intelligent eyes on the two across the
street, who now stood under a lamp-post, engaged in
some sort of drunken altercation.</p>
<p>Renoux, watching them all the while, continued in
a low voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, Barres, if we chance to meet again here
in America, I am merely Georges Renoux, an architect
and a fellow Beaux Arts man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.... Look! They&#8217;re starting on, those
two!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; whispered Renoux.</p>
<p>Soane, unsteady of leg and talkative, was now making
for Third Avenue beside Freund, who had taken
him by the arm, in hopes, apparently, of steadying
them both.</p>
<p>As Renoux and Barres followed, the latter cautiously
requested any instructions which Renoux might
think fit to give.</p>
<p>Renoux said in his cool, agreeable voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it&#8217;s rather unusual for an officer to
bother personally with this sort of thing. But my
people&mdash;even the renegade Germans in our service&mdash;have
been unable to obtain necessary information for
us in regard to Grogan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happened this afternoon that certain information
was brought to me which suggested that I myself
take a look at Grogan&#8217;s. And that is what I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
was going to do when I saw you on the street, carefully
stalking two well-known suspects.&#8221;</p>
<p>They both laughed cautiously.</p>
<p>Grogan&#8217;s was now in sight on the corner, its cherrywood
magnificence and its bilious imitation of stained
glass aglow with electricity. And into its &#8220;Family
Entrance&#8221; swaggered Soane, followed by the lank figure
of Max Freund.</p>
<p>Renoux and Barres had halted fifty yards away.
Neither spoke. And presently came to them a short,
dark, powerfully built man, who strolled up casually,
puffing a large, rank cigar.</p>
<p>Renoux named him to Barres:</p>
<p>&#8220;Emile Souchez, one of my men.&#8221; He added:
&#8220;Anybody gone in yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Otto Klein, of Gerhardt, Klein &amp; Schwartzmeyer
went in an hour ago,&#8221; replied Souchez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oho,&#8221; nodded Renoux softly. &#8220;That signifies
something really interesting. Who else went in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Small fry&mdash;Dave Sendelbeck, Louis Hochstein,
Terry Madigan, Dolan, McBride, Clancy&mdash;all Clan-na-Gael
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skeel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s still at the Astor. Franz Lehr came
out about half an hour ago and took a taxi west.
Jacques Alost is following in another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux thought a moment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lehr has probably gone to see Skeel at the Hotel
Astor,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have our
chance, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, turning to Barres:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve decided to take a sport-chance to-night. We
have most reliable information that this man Lehr,
who now owns Grogan&#8217;s, will carry here upon his person
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
papers of importance to my Government&mdash;and to
yours, too, Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man from whom he shall procure these papers
is an Irish gentleman named Murtagh Skeel, just arrived
from Buffalo and stopping overnight at the Hotel
Astor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lehr, we were informed, was to go personally and
get those papers.... Do you really wish to help
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. I expect we shall have what you call
a mix-up. You will please, therefore, walk into Grogan&#8217;s&mdash;not
by the family entrance, but by the swinging
doors on Lexington Avenue. Kindly refresh yourself
there with some Munich beer; also eat a sandwich
at my expense, if you care to. Then you will give
yourself the pains to inquire the way to the wash-room.
And there you will possess your soul in amiable
patience until you shall hear me speak your name
in a very quiet, polite tone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, recognising the familiar mock seriousness
of student days in Paris, began to smile. Renoux
frowned and continued his instructions:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you hear me politely pronounce your name,
mon vieux, then you shall precipitate yourself valiantly
to the aid of Monsieur Souchez and myself&mdash;and perhaps
Monsieur Alost&mdash;and help us to hold, gag and
search the somewhat violent German animal whom we
corner inside the family entrance of Herr Grogan!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres had difficulty in restraining his laughter.
Renoux was very serious, with the delightful mock
gravity of a witty and perfectly fearless Frenchman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lehr?&#8221; inquired Barres, still laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the animal under discussion. There will be
a taxicab awaiting us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He turned to Souchez:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
&#8220;Dis, donc, Emile, faut employer ton coup du Pêre
François pour nous assurer de cet animal là.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B&#8217;en sure,&#8221; nodded Souchez, fishing furtively in the
side pocket of his coat and displaying the corner of
a red silk handkerchief. He stuffed it into his pocket
again; Renoux smiled carelessly at Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mon vieux,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I hope it will be like a good
fight in the Quarter&mdash;what with all those Irish in there.
You desire to get your head broken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I do, Renoux!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bien! So now, if you are quite ready?&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;Merci, monsieur, et à bientôt!&#8221; He bowed
profoundly.</p>
<p>Barres, still laughing, walked to Lexington Avenue,
crossed northward, and entered the swinging doors of
Grogan&#8217;s, perfectly enchanted to have his finger in the
pie at last, and aching for an old-fashioned Latin
Quarter row, the pleasures of which he had not known
for several too respectable years.</p>

<h2>XX
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />GROGAN&#8217;S</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The material attraction of Grogan&#8217;s was principally
German beer; the æsthetic appeal of
the place was also characteristically Teutonic
and consisted of peculiarly offensive decorations, including
much red cherry, much imitation stained glass,
many sprawling brass fixtures, and many electric lights.
Only former inmates of the Fatherland could have
conceived and executed the embellishments of Grogan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>There was a palatial bar, behind which fat, white-jacketed
Teutons served slopping steins of beer upon
a perforated brass surface. There was a centre table,
piled with those barbarous messes known to the undiscriminating
Hun as &#8220;delicatessen&#8221;&mdash;raw fish, sour
fish, smoked fish, flabby portions of defunct pig in various
guises&mdash;all naturally nauseating to the white
man&#8217;s olfactories and palate, and all equally relished
by the beer-swilling boche.</p>
<p>A bartender with Pekinese and apoplectic eyes and
the scorbutic facial symptoms of a Strassburg liver,
took the order from Barres and set before him a frosty
glass of Pilsner, incidentally drenching the bar at the
same time with swipes, which he thriftily scraped
through the perforated brass strainer into a slop-bucket
underneath.</p>
<p>Being a stranger there, Barres was furtively scrutinised
at first, but there seemed to be nothing particularly
suspicious about a young man who stopped in for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
a glass of Pilsner on a July night, and nobody paid
him any further attention.</p>
<p>Besides, two United States Secret Service men had
just gone out, followed, as usual, by one Johnny Klein;
and the Germans at the tables at the bar, and behind
the bar were still sneeringly commenting on the episode&mdash;now
a familiar one and of nightly occurrence.</p>
<p>So only very casual attention was paid to Barres and
his Pilsner and his rye-bread and sardine sandwich,
which he took over to a vacant table to desiccate and
discuss at his leisure.</p>
<p>People came and went; conversation in Hunnish gutturals
became general; soiled evening newspapers were
read, raw fish seized in fat red fingers and suckingly
masticated; also, skat and pinochle were resumed with
unwiped hands, and there was loud slapping of cards
on polished table tops, and many porcine noises.</p>
<p>Barres finished his Pilsner, side-stepped the sandwich,
rose, asked a bartender for the wash-room, and
leisurely followed the direction given.</p>
<p>There was nobody in there. He had, for company,
a mouse, a soiled towel on a roller, and the remains
of some unattractive soap. He lighted a cigarette,
surveyed himself in the looking glass, cast a friendly
glance at the mouse, and stood waiting, flexing his
biceps muscles with a smile of anticipated pleasure in
renewing the use of them after such a very long period
wasted in the peaceful pursuit of art.</p>
<p>For he was still a boy at heart. All creative minds
retain something of those care-free, irresponsible years
as long as the creative talent lasts. As it fails,
worldly caution creeps in like a thief in the night, to
steal the spontaneous pleasures of the past and leave
in their places only the old galoshes of prudence and
the finger-prints of dull routine.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>Barres stood by the open door of the wash-room,
listening. The corridor which passed it led on into
another corridor running at right angles. This was
the Family Entrance.</p>
<p>Now, as he waited there, he heard the street door
open, and instantly the deadened shock of a rush and
struggle.</p>
<p>As he started toward the Family Entrance, straining
his ears for the expected summons, a man in flight
turned the corner into his corridor so abruptly that
he had him by the throat even before he recognised in
him the man with the thick eye-glasses who had hit
him between the eyes with a pistol&mdash;the &#8220;Watcher&#8221; of
Dragon Court!</p>
<p>With a swift sigh of gratitude to Chance, Barres
folded the fleeing Watcher to his bosom and began
the business he had to transact with him&mdash;an account
too long overdue.</p>
<p>The Watcher fought like a wildcat, but in silence&mdash;fought
madly, using both fists, feet, baring his teeth,
too, with frantic attempts to use them. But Barres
gave him no opportunity to kick, bite, or to pull out
any weapon; he battered the Watcher right and left,
swinging on him like lightning, and his blows drummed
on him like the tattoo of fists on a punching bag until
one stinging crack sent the Watcher&#8217;s head snapping
back with a jerk, and a terrific jolt knocked him as
clean and as flat as a dead carp.</p>
<p>There were papers in his coat, also a knuckle-duster,
a big clasp-knife, and an automatic pistol. And Barres
took them all, stuffed them into his own pockets, and,
dragging his still dormant but twitching victim by the
collar, as a cat proudly lugs a heavy rat, he started
for the Family Entrance, where Donnybrook had now
broken loose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>But the silence of the terrific struggle in that narrow
entry, the absence of all yelling, was significant.
No Irish whoops, no Teutonic din of combat shattered
the stillness of that dim corridor&mdash;only the deadened
sounds of blows and shuffling of frantic feet. It was
very evident that nobody involved desired to be interrupted
by the police, or call attention to the location
of the battle field.</p>
<p>Renoux, Souchez, and a third companion were in
intimate and desperate conflict with half a dozen other
men&mdash;dim, furious figures fighting there under the flickering
gas jet from which the dirty globe had been
knocked into fragments.</p>
<p>Into this dusty maelstrom of waving arms and legs
went Barres&mdash;first dropping his now inert prey&mdash;and
began to hit out enthusiastically right and left, at the
nearest hostile countenance visible.</p>
<p>His was a flank attack and totally unexpected by <ins title='Removed duplicate word'>the</ins>
attackees; and the diversion gave Renoux time to
seize a muscular, struggling opponent, hold him squirming
while Souchez passed his handkerchief over his
throat and the third man turned his pockets inside
out.</p>
<p>Then Renoux called breathlessly to Barres:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, mon vieux! Face to the rear front!
March!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment they stiffened to face a battering rush
from the stairs. Suddenly a pistol spoke, and an
Irish voice burst out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whist, ye domm fool! G&#8217;wan wid yer fishtin&#8217; an&#8217;
can th&#8217; goon-play!&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a splintering crash as the rickety banisters
gave way and several Teutonic and Hibernian
warriors fell in a furious heap, blocking the entry with
an unpremeditated obstacle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>Instantly Souchez, Barres and the other man backed
out into the street, followed nimbly by Renoux and
his plunder.</p>
<p>Already a typical Third Avenue crowd was gathering,
though the ominous glimmer of a policeman&#8217;s buttons
had not yet caught the lamplight from the street
corner.</p>
<p>Then the door of Grogan&#8217;s burst open and an embattled
Irishman appeared. But at first glance the
hopelessness of the situation presented itself to him;
a taxi loaded with French and American franc-tireurs
was already honking triumphantly away westward; an
excited and rapidly increasing throng pressed around
the Family Entrance; also, the distant glitter of a
policeman&#8217;s shield and buttons now extinguished all
hope of pursuit.</p>
<p>Soane glared at the crowd out of enraged and blood-shot
eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan home, ye bunch of bums!&#8221; he said thickly,
and slammed the door to the Family Entrance of Grogan&#8217;s
notorious café.</p>
<p>At 42d Street and Madison Avenue the taxi stopped
and Souchez and Alost got out and went rapidly across
the street toward the Grand Central depot. Then the
taxi proceeded west, north again, then once more west.</p>
<p>Renoux, busy with a bleeding nose, remarked carelessly
that Souchez and Alost were taking a train and
were in a hurry, and that he himself was going back
to the Astor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not mind coming with me, Barres?&#8221; he
added. &#8220;In my rooms we can have a bite and a glass
together, and then we can brush up. That was a nice
little fight, was it not, mon ami?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Barres with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite like the old and happy days,&#8221; mused Renoux,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
surveying wilted collar and rumpled tie of his comrade.
&#8220;You came off well; you have merely a bruised cheek.&#8221;
His eyes began to sparkle and he laughed: &#8220;Do you
remember that May evening when your very quarrelsome
atelier barricaded the Café de la Source and forbade
us to enter&mdash;and my atelier marched down the
Boul&#8217; Mich&#8217; with its Kazoo band playing our atelier
march, determined to take your café by assault? Oh,
my! What a delightful fight that was!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your crazy comrades stuffed me into the fountain
among the goldfish. I thought I&#8217;d drown,&#8221; said
Barres, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but your atelier gained a great victory
that night, and you came over to Müller&#8217;s with your
Kazoo band playing the Fireman&#8217;s March, and you carried
away our palms and bay-trees in their green tubs,
and you threw them over the Pont-au-Change into the
Seine!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>They were laughing like a pair of schoolboys now,
quite convulsed and holding to each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; gasped Barres, &#8220;that girl who
danced the Carmagnole on the Quay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yvonne Tête-de-Linotte!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the British giant from Julien&#8217;s, who threw
everybody out of the Café Montparnasse and invited
the Quarter in to a free banquet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McNeil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ever became of that pretty girl, Doucette de
Valmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was she who cheered on your atelier to the
assault on Müllers!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughter stifled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What crazy creatures we all were,&#8221; said Renoux,
staunching the last crimson drops oozing from his nose.
Then, more soberly: &#8220;We French have a grimmer affair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
over there than the joyous rows of the Latin Quarter.
I&#8217;m sorry now that we didn&#8217;t throw every waiter in
Müller&#8217;s after the bay-trees. There would have been
so many fewer spies to betray France.&#8221;</p>
<p>The taxi stopped at the 44th Street entrance to the
Astor. They descended, Renoux leading, walked
through the corridor to Peacock Alley, turned to the
right through the bar, then to the left into the lobby,
and thence to the elevator.</p>
<p>In Renoux&#8217;s rooms they turned on the electric light,
locked the door, closed the transom, then spread their
plunder out on a table.</p>
<p>To Renoux&#8217;s disgust his own loot consisted of sealed
envelopes full of clippings from German newspapers
published in Chicago, Milwaukee, and New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;That animal, Lehr,&#8221; he said with a wry face, &#8220;has
certainly played us a filthy turn. These clippings
amount to nothing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His eyes fell on the packet
of papers which Barres was now opening, and he leaned
over his shoulder to look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; he said, &#8220;here they are! Where on
earth did you find these papers, Barres? They&#8217;re the
documents we were after! They ought to have been
in Lehr&#8217;s pockets!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have passed them to the fellow who
bumped into me near the wash-room,&#8221; said Barres, enchanted
at his luck. &#8220;What a fortunate chance that
you sent me around there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux, delighted, stood under the electric light unfolding
document after document, and nodding his
handsome, mischievous head with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck, Barres! What did you do to the fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thumped him to sleep and turned out his pockets.
Are these really what you want?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I should say so! This is precisely what we are
looking for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind if I read them, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. Why should I? You&#8217;re my loyal
comrade and you understand discretion.... <i>What</i>
do you think of <i>this</i>!&#8221; displaying a typewritten document
marked &#8220;Copy,&#8221; enclosing a sheaf of maps.</p>
<p>It contained plans of all the East River and Harlem
bridges, a tracing showing the course of the new aqueduct
and the Ashokan Dam, drawings of the Navy
Yard, a map of Iona Island, and a plan of the Welland
Canal.</p>
<p>The document was brief:</p>
<blockquote>

Section 7-4-11-B. Recommended that detail plan

</blockquote>
<p>Followed several sheets in cipher, evidently some intricate
variation of those which are always ultimately
solved by experts.</p>
<p>But the documents that were now unfolded by Captain
Renoux proved readable and intensely interesting.</p>
<p>These were the papers which Renoux read and which
Barres read over his shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will note particularly the Article numbered 7.</p>

attempt to seize on the high seas a British or neutral
steamer loaded with arms and munitions, and make a
landing from her on the Irish Coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, in the meantime, is it not possible for you to seize
one of the large ore steamers on the Great Lakes, transfer
to her sufficient explosives, take her into the Welland Canal

<p>&#8220;No more valuable service could be performed by Irishmen;

<p>&#8220;I am, my dear Skeel, your sincere friend and comrade,</p>
<p class='sig1'>&#8220;(Signed) <span class='smcap'>Von Papen</span>.</p>
<p>&#8220;P. S.&mdash;Herewith appended are Articles 6 and 7 included
in the Casement convention:</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;(SECRET)</p>
<p>&#8220;Text of Articles 6 and 7 of the convention concluded
between Sir Roger Casement and the German Government:</p>
<p>&#8220;6. The German Imperial Government undertakes &#8216;under
certain circumstances&#8217; to lend the Irish Brigade adequate
military support, and to send it to Ireland abundantly
supplied with arms and ammunition, in order that once
there it may equip any Irish who would like to join it in
making an attempt to re-establish Ireland&#8217;s national liberty
by force of arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;special circumstances&#8217; stipulated above are as
follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;In case of a German naval victory which would make
it possible to reach the Irish coast, the German Imperial
Government pledges itself to despatch the Irish Brigade
and a German expeditionary corps commanded by German
officers, in German troopships, to attempt a landing on the
Irish coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;7. It will be impossible to contemplate a landing in
Ireland unless the German Navy can gain such a victory
as to make it really likely that an attempt to reach Ireland
by sea would succeed. Should the German Navy not win
such a victory, then a use will be found for the Irish
Brigade in Germany or elsewhere. But in no case will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
it be used except in such ways as Sir Roger Casement shall
approve, as being completely in accordance with Article 2.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case the Irish Brigade might be sent to Egypt
to lend assistance in expelling the English and re-establishing
Egyptian independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the Irish Brigade should not succeed in fighting
for the liberation of Ireland from the English yoke, nevertheless
a blow dealt at the British intruders in Egypt and
intended to help the Egyptians to recover their freedom
would be a blow struck for a cause closely related to that
of Ireland.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another paper read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class='sig2'>&#8220;Halbmondlager,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Irish Exp. Force,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;N. Y.</p>
<p class='center'>&#8220;REPORT</p>
<p>&#8220;On June 7, fifty Irishmen, with one German subaltern,
were handed over to this camp, to be temporarily accommodated
here. On June 16 five more Irishmen arrived,
one of whom, having a broken leg, was sent to the camp
hospital. There are, therefore, fifty-four Irishmen now
here, one Sergeant Major, one Deputy Sergeant Major,
three Sergeants, three Corporals, three Lance Corporals,
and forty-three privates.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were accommodated as well as could be among
the Indian battalion, an arrangement which gives rise to
much trouble, which is inevitable, considering the tasks
imposed upon Half Moon Camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Irish form an Irish brigade, which was constituted
after negotiations between the Foreign Office and Sir
Roger Casement, the champion of Irish independence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enclosed is the Foreign Office communication of Dec.
28, 1914, confirming the conditions on which the Irish
brigade was to be formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The members of the Irish brigade are no longer German
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
prisoners of war, but receive an Irish uniform; and,
according to orders, instructions are to be issued to treat
the Irish as comrades in arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Irish are under the command of a German officer,
First Lieut. Boehm, the representative of the Grand General
Staff (Political Division) which is in direct communication
with the subaltern in charge of the Irish. This
subaltern has been receiving money direct, which he expends
in the interests of the Irish; 250 marks were given
him through the Commandant&#8217;s office, Zossen, and 250 marks
by First Lieut. Boehm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promotions, also, are made known by being directly
communicated to the subaltern in question. As will appear
from the enclosed copy, dated July 20, these promotions
were as follows: (1) Sergeant Major, (2) Deputy Sergeant
Major, and (3) Sergeants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The uniforms arrived between the end of July and the
beginning of August. Their coming was announced in a
letter dated July 20 (copy enclosed), and their distribution
was ordered. The box of uniforms was addressed to
Zossen, whence it was brought here. The uniforms consist
of a jacket, trousers, and cap in Irish style, and are
of huntsman&#8217;s green cloth. Altogether, uniforms arrived
for fifty men, and they have since been given out. Three
non-commissioned officers brought their uniforms with them
from Limburg on July 16. Two photographs of the Irish
are annexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few Irish are in correspondence with Sir Roger
Casement, who, in a letter from Munich, dated Aug. 16,
says that he hears that the Irish are shortly to be transferred
from here to another place. In a letter dated
July 17 he complains of his want of success, only fifty men
having sent in their names as wishing to join the brigade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six weeks ago Sir Roger Casement was here with First
Lieutenant Boehm. Since then, however, neither of these
gentlemen has personally visited the Irish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the 18th of June the commandant&#8217;s office has
allowed every penniless Irishman two marks a week&mdash;a
sum which is now being paid out to fifty-three men.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Aug. 6 the subaltern in charge of the Irish brigade
was given a German soldier to help him.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this camp every possible endeavour is made to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
help to attain the important objects in view, but owing
to the Irish being accommodated with coloured races within
the precincts of a closed camp, it is inevitable that serious
dissensions and acts of violence should take place. Moreover,
a German subaltern is not suited for dealing independently
with Irishmen.</p>

<p>Renoux glanced curiously at Barres, who had turned
very red and was beginning to re-read the wireless.</p>
<p>When he finished, Renoux folded all the documents
and placed them in the breast pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mon ami, Barres,&#8221; he said pleasantly, &#8220;you and
I have much yet to say to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meanwhile, let us wash the stains of combat
from our persons. What is the number of your collar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen and a half.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Refreshed by icy baths and clean linen, and
now further fortified against the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune by a supper of
cold fowl and Moselle, Captain Renoux and Garret
Barres sat in the apartment of the former gentleman,
gaily exchanging Latin Quarter reminiscences through
the floating haze of their cigars.</p>
<p>But the conversation soon switched back toward the
far more serious business which alone accounted for
their being there together after many years. For, as
the French officer had remarked, a good deal remained
to be said between them. And Barres knew what he
meant, and was deeply concerned at the prospect.</p>
<p>But Renoux approached the matter with careless
good humour and by a leisurely, circuitous route, which
polite pussy-footing was obviously to prepare Barres
for impending trouble.</p>
<p>He began by referring to his mission in America,
admitting very frankly that he was a modest link in
the system of military and political intelligence maintained
by all European countries in the domains of
their neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well say so,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;because it&#8217;s
known to the representatives of enemy governments
here as well as to your own Government, that some of
us are here; and anybody can imagine why.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, in the course of my&mdash;studies,&#8221; he said deliberately,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
while his clear eyes twinkled, &#8220;it has come to
my knowledge, and to the knowledge of the French
Ambassador, that there is, in New York, a young
woman who already has proven herself a dangerous
enemy to my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is interesting, if true,&#8221; said Barres, reddening
to the temples. &#8220;But it is even more interesting
if it is not true.... And it isn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anything about it, Renoux; I <i>know</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid you have been misled, Barres. And it
is natural enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Renoux serenely, &#8220;she is very beautiful,
very clever, very young, very appealing....
Tell me, my friend, where did you meet her?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres looked him in the eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn that I had ever met her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the ordinary channels which, if you will
pardon me, I am not at liberty to discuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. It is sufficient that you know I have
met her. Now, where did I meet her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Renoux candidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have I known her then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly a few weeks. Our information is that
your acquaintance with her is not of long duration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong, my friend: I met her in France several
years ago; I know her intimately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the intimacy has been reported,&#8221; said Renoux,
blandly. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t take long, sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres reddened again and shook his head:</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your agents are all wrong, Renoux. So
is your Government. Do you know what it&#8217;s doing&mdash;what
you and your agents are doing? You&#8217;re playing
a German game for Berlin!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>This time Renoux flushed and there was a slight
quiver to his lips and nostrils; but he said very pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be rather mortifying, mon ami, if it
were true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true. Berlin, the traitor in Paris, the conspirator
in America, the German, Austrian, and Turkish
diplomatic agents here ask nothing better than that
you manage, somehow, to eliminate the person in question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Renoux.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because more than one of your public men in Paris
will face charges of conspiracy and treason if the person
in question ever has a fair hearing and a chance
to prove her innocence of the terrible accusations that
have been made against her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; said Renoux, &#8220;those accused bring
counter charges. It is always the history of such
cases, mon ami.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your mind is already made up, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mind is a real mind, Barres. Reason is what
it seeks&mdash;the logical evidence that leads to truth. If
there is anything I don&#8217;t know, then I wish to know
it, and will spare no pains, permit no prejudice to
warp my judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Now, let&#8217;s have the thing out between
us, Renoux. We are not fencing in the dark; we understand
each other and are honest enough to say so.
Now, go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux nodded and said very quietly and pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The reference in one of these papers to the celebrated
Nihla Quellen reminds me of the first time I
ever saw her. I was quite bowled over, Barres, as you
may easily imagine. She sang one of those Asiatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
songs&mdash;and then the dance!&mdash;a miracle!&mdash;a delight&mdash;apparently
entirely unprepared, unpremeditated even&mdash;you
know how she did it?&mdash;exquisite perfection&mdash;something
charmingly impulsive and spontaneous&mdash;a
caprice of the moment! Ah&mdash;there is a wonderful artiste,
Nihla Quellen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres nodded, his level gaze fixed on the French
officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the document,&#8221; continued Renoux, &#8220;it does
not entirely explain itself to me. You see, this Eurasian,
Ferez Bey, was a very intimate friend of Nihla
Quellen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite mistaken,&#8221; interposed Barres. But
the other merely smiled with a slight gesture of deference
to his friend&#8217;s opinion, and went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Ferez is one of those persistent, annoying
flies which buzz around chancelleries and stir up diplomats
to pernicious activities. You know there isn&#8217;t
much use in swatting, as you say, the fly. No. Better
find the manure heap which hatched him and burn
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled and shrugged, relighted his cigar, and
continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;So, mon ami, I am here in your charming and hospitable
city to direct the necessary sanitary measures,
sub rosa, of course. You have been more than kind.
My Government and I have you to thank for this batch
of papers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He tapped his breast pocket and
made salutes which Frenchmen alone know how to
make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Renoux,&#8221; said Barres bluntly, &#8220;you have learned
somehow that Nihla Quellen is under my protection.
You conclude I am her lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer&#8217;s face altered gravely, but he said nothing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>Barres leaned forward in his chair and laid a hand
on his comrade&#8217;s shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;Renoux, do you trust me, personally?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Then I shall trust you. Because there
is nothing you can tell me about Nihla Quellen that I
do not already know&mdash;nothing concerning her <i>dossier</i>
in your secret archives, nothing in regard to the evidence
against her and the testimony of the Count
d&#8217;Eblis. And that clears the ground between you and
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Renoux was surprised he scarcely showed it.</p>
<p>Barres said:</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you know that she is under my protection,
I want you to come to my place and talk to her.
I don&#8217;t ask you to accept my judgment in regard to
her; I merely wish you to listen to what she has to
say, and then come to your own conclusions. Will
you do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few moments Renoux sat quite still, his clear,
intelligent eyes fixed on the smoking tip of his cigar.
Without raising them he said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;As we understand it, Nihla Quellen has been a
spy from the very beginning. Our information is
clear, concise, logical. We know her history. She
was the mistress of Prince Cyril, then of Ferez, then
of d&#8217;Eblis&mdash;perhaps of the American banker, Gerhardt,
also. She came directly from the German Embassy
at Constantinople to Paris, on Gerhardt&#8217;s yacht,
the <i>Mirage</i>, and under his protection and the protection
of Comte Alexandre d&#8217;Eblis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez was of the party. And that companionship
of conspirators never was dissolved as long as Nihla
Quellen remained in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Nihla Quellen has ever been the mistress of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
any man is singularly untrue,&#8221; said Barres coolly.
&#8220;Your Government has to do with a chaste woman;
and it doesn&#8217;t even know that much!&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux regarded him curiously:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen her dance?&#8221; he enquired gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often. And, Renoux, you are too much a man of
the world to be surprised at the unexpected. There
<i>are</i> white blackbirds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla Quellen is one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend, I desire to believe it if it would be agreeable
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, Renoux; I believe in your good-will. Also,
I believe in your honesty and intelligence. And so I
do not ask you to accept my word for what I tell you.
Only remember that I am absolutely certain concerning
my belief in Nihla Quellen.... I have no doubt
that you think I am in love with her.... I can&#8217;t
answer you. All Europe was in love with her. Perhaps
I am.... I don&#8217;t know, Renoux. But this I
do know; she is clean and sweet and honest from the
crown of her head to the sole of her foot. In her heart
there has never dwelt treachery. Talk to her to-night.
You&#8217;re like the best of your compatriots, clear minded,
logical, intelligent, and full of that legitimate imagination
without which intellect is a machine. You know
the world; you know men; you don&#8217;t know women and
you know you don&#8217;t. Therefore, you are equipped to
learn the truth&mdash;to divine it&mdash;from Nihla Quellen.
Will you come over to my place now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Renoux pleasantly.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The orchestra was playing as they passed through
the hotel; supper rooms, corridors, café and lobby were
crowded with post-theatre throngs in search of food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
and drink and dance music; and although few theatres
were open in July, Long Acre blazed under its myriad
lights and the sidewalks were packed with the audiences
filtering out of the various summer shows and into all-night
cabarets.</p>
<p>They looked across at the distant war bulletins displayed
on Times Square, around which the usual gesticulating
crowd had gathered, but kept on across
Long Acre, and west toward Sixth Avenue.</p>
<p>Midway in the block, Renoux touched his comrade
silently on the arm, and halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few minutes, mon ami, if you don&#8217;t mind&mdash;time
for you to smoke a cigarette while waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had stopped before a brownstone house which
had been converted into a basement dwelling, and
which was now recessed between two modern shops constructed
as far as the building line.</p>
<p>All the shades and curtains in the house were drawn
and the place appeared to be quite dark, but a ring
at the bell brought a big, powerfully built porter, who
admitted them to a brightly lighted reception room.
Then the porter replaced the chains on the door of
bronze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little while, if you will be amiable enough
to have patience,&#8221; said Renoux.</p>
<p>He went away toward the rear of the house and
Barres seated himself. And in a few moments the burly
porter reappeared with a tray containing a box of
cigarettes and a tall glass of Moselle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur Renoux will not be long,&#8221; he said, bringing
a sheaf of French illustrated periodicals to the
little table at Barres&#8217; elbow; and he retired with a
bow and resumed his chair in the corridor by the bronze
door.</p>
<p>Through closed doors, somewhere from the rear of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
the silent house came the distant click of a typewriter.
At moments, too, looking over the war pictures in the
periodicals, Barres imagined that he heard a confused
murmur as of many voices.</p>
<p>Later it became evident that there were a number
of people somewhere in the house, because, now and
then, the porter unlatched the door and drew the
chains to let out some swiftly walking man.</p>
<p>Once two men came out together. One carried a
satchel; the other halted in the hallway to slip a clip
into an automatic pistol before dropping it into the
side pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>And after a while Renoux appeared, bland, debonaire,
evidently much pleased with whatever he had
been doing.</p>
<p>Two other men appeared in the corridor behind him;
he said something to them in a low voice; Barres imagined
he heard the words, &#8220;Washington&#8221; and &#8220;Jusserand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the two men went out, walking at a smart pace,
and Renoux sauntered into the tiny reception room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what a very important
service you have rendered us by catching that fellow
to-night and stripping him of his papers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres rose and they walked out together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This city,&#8221; added Renoux, &#8220;is fairly verminous with
disloyal Huns. The streets are crawling with them;
every German resort, saloon, beer garden, keller, café,
club, society&mdash;every German drug store, delicatessen
shop, music store, tobacconist, is lousy with the treacherous
swine.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two great hotels where the boche gathers
and plots; two great banking firms are centres of
German propaganda; three great department stores,
dozens of downtown commercial agencies; various
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
buildings and piers belonging to certain transatlantic
steamship lines, the offices of certain newspapers and
periodicals.... Tell me, Barres, did you know that
the banker, Gerhardt, owns the building in which you
live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dragon Court!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know it, evidently. Yes, he owns it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he really involved in pro-German intrigue?&#8221;
asked Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is our information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ask,&#8221; continued Barres thoughtfully, &#8220;because his
summer home is at Northbrook, not far from my own
home. And to me there is something peculiarly contemptible
about disloyalty in the wealthy who owe
every penny to the country they betray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His place is called Hohenlinden,&#8221; remarked Renoux.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Are you having it watched?&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux smiled. Perhaps he was thinking about
other places, also&mdash;the German Embassy, for example,
where, inside the Embassy itself, not only France but
also the United States Government was represented by
a secret agent among the personnel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try to learn what goes on among the boches,&#8221;
he said carelessly. &#8220;They try the same game. But,
Barres, they are singularly stupid at such things&mdash;not
adroit, merely clumsy and brutal. The Hun cannot
camouflage his native ferocity. He reveals himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in that respect it is fortunate for civilisation
that it is dealing with barbarians. Their cunning is
of the swinish sort. Their stench ultimately discovers
them. You are discovering it for yourselves; you detected
Dernberg; you already sniff Von Papen, Boy-ed,
Bernstorff. All over the world the nauseous effluvia
from the vast Teutonic hog-pen is being detected and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
recognised. And civilisation is taking sanitary measures
to abate the nuisance.... And your country,
too, will one day send out a sanitary brigade to help
clean up the world, just as you now supply our details
with the necessary chlorides and antiseptics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very picturesque,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll tell
you one thing, if we don&#8217;t join the sanitary corps now
operating, I shall go out with a bottle of chloride
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered Dragon Court a few moments later.
Nobody was at the desk, it being late.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Barres, as they ascended the
stairs, &#8220;my friends, Miss Soane, Miss Dunois, and
Mr. Westmore are to be our guests at Foreland Farms.
You didn&#8217;t know that, did you?&#8221; he added sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Renoux, much amused. &#8220;Miss
Dunois, as you call her, sent her trunks away this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres, surprised and annoyed, halted on the landing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your people didn&#8217;t interfere, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There was nothing in them of interest to us,&#8221;
said Renoux naïvely. &#8220;I sent a report when I sent on
to Washington the papers which you secured for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres paused before his studio door, key in hand.
They could hear the gramophone going inside. He
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to ask you to be fair, Renoux, because
the man who is unfair to others swindles himself, and
you are too decent, too intelligent to do that. I am
going to present you to Thessalie Dunois, which happens
to be her real name, and I am going to tell her
in your presence who you are. Then I shall leave you
alone with her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>He fitted his latchkey and opened the door.</p>
<p>Westmore was trying fancy dancing with Dulcie
on one side, and Thessalie on the other&mdash;the latter
evidently directing operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry!&#8221; exclaimed Thessalie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine one! Where have you been?&#8221; began
Westmore. Then he caught sight of Renoux and became
silent.</p>
<p>Barres led his comrade forward and presented
him:</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow student of the Beaux Arts,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;and we&#8217;ve had a very jolly evening together. And,
Thessa, there is something in particular that I should
like to have you explain to Monsieur Renoux, if you
don&#8217;t mind....&#8221; He turned and looked at Dulcie:
&#8220;If you will pardon us a moment, Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded and smiled and took Westmore&#8217;s arm
again, and continued the dance alone with him while
Barres, drawing Thessalie&#8217;s arm through his, and passing
his other arm through Renoux&#8217;s, walked leisurely
through his studio, through the now open folding doors,
past his bedroom and Westmore&#8217;s, and into the latter&#8217;s
studio beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa, dear,&#8221; he said very quietly, &#8220;I feel very
certain that the worst of your troubles are about to
end&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He felt her start slightly. &#8220;And,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I have brought my comrade, Renoux, here
to-night so that you and he can clear up a terrible
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Monsieur Renoux, once a student of architecture
at the Beaux Arts, is now Captain Renoux of
the Intelligence Department in the French Army&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie lost her colour and a tremor passed
through the arm which lay within his.</p>
<p>But he said calmly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is the only way as well as the best way, Thessa.
I know you are absolutely innocent. I am confident
that Captain Renoux is going to believe it, too. If he
does not, you are no worse off. Because it has already
become known to the French Government that
you are here. Renoux knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had halted; Barres led Thessalie to a seat.
Renoux, straight, deferential, correct, awaited her
pleasure.</p>
<p>She looked up at him; his keen, intelligent eyes met
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, Captain Renoux, will you do me
the honour to be seated?&#8221; she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Barres went to her, bent over her hand, touched it
with his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tell him the truth, Thessa, dear,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything?&#8221; she smiled faintly, &#8220;including our
first meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres flushed, then laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, tell him about that, too. It was too charming
for him not to appreciate.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with a half mischievous, half amused nod to
Renoux he went back to find the dancers, whom he
could hear laughing far away in his own studio.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was nearly one o&#8217;clock when Dulcie, who had been
sleeping with Thessalie, whispered to Barres that she
was ready to retire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you had better,&#8221; he said, releasing her as
the dance music ran down and ceased. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t
get some sleep you won&#8217;t feel like travelling to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you explain to Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Good-night, dear.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>She gave him her hand in silence, turned and offered
it to Westmore, then went away toward her room.</p>
<p>Westmore, who had been fidgeting a lot since Thessalie
had retired for a tête-à-tête with a perfectly unknown
and alarmingly good-looking young man whom
he never before had laid eyes on, finally turned short
in his restless pacing of the studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the deuce can be keeping Thessa?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;And who the devil is that black-eyed young
sprig of France you brought home with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down and I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said Barres crisply,
instinctively resenting his friend&#8217;s uncalled for solicitude
in Thessalie&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>So Westmore seated himself and Barres told him
all about the evening&#8217;s adventures. And he was still
lingering unctuously over the details of the battle at
Grogan&#8217;s, the recital of which, Westmore demanding,
he had begun again, when at the farther end of the
studio Thessalie appeared, coming toward them.</p>
<p>Renoux was beside her, very deferential and graceful
in his attendance, and with that niceness of attitude
which confesses respect in every movement.</p>
<p>Thessalie came forward; Barres advanced to meet
her with the unspoken question in his eyes, and she
gave him both her hands with a tremulous little smile
of happiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it all right?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres turned and grasped Renoux by one hand.</p>
<p>The latter said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not the slightest doubt in my mind, mon
ami. You were perfectly right. A frightful injustice
has been done in this matter. Of that I am absolutely
convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do what you can to set things right?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Renoux simply.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then Renoux smiled:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he said lightly, &#8220;we French have a
horror of any more mistakes like the Dreyfus case.
We are terribly sensitive. Be assured that my Government
will take up this affair instantly upon receiving
my report.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Barres:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you, perhaps, offer me a day&#8217;s hospitality
at your home in the country, if I should request it
by telegram sometime this week or next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; replied Barres cordially.</p>
<p>Then Renoux made his adieux, as only such a
Frenchman can make them, saying exactly the right
thing to each, in exactly the right manner.</p>
<p>When he was gone, Barres took Thessalie&#8217;s hands
and pressed them:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty merle-blanc, your little friend Dulcie is already
asleep. Tell us to-morrow how you convinced
him that you are what you are&mdash;the dearest, sweetest
girl in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed demurely, then glanced apprehensively,
sideways, at Westmore.</p>
<p>And the mute but infuriated expression on that
young man&#8217;s countenance seemed to cause her the loss
of all self-possession, for she cast one more look at
him and fled with a hasty &#8220;good-night!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />FORELAND FARMS</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Toward three o&#8217;clock on the following afternoon
the sun opened up like a searchlight
through the veil of rain, dissolving it to a
golden haze which gradually grew thinner and thinner,
revealing glimpses of rolling country against a horizon
of low mountains.</p>
<p>About the same time the covered station wagon
turned in between the white gates of Foreland Farms,
proceeded at a smart trot up the drive, and stopped
under a dripping porte-cochère, where a smiling servant
stood waiting to lift out the luggage.</p>
<p>A trim looking man of forty odd, in soft shirt and
fawn coloured knickers, and wearing a monocle in his
right eye and a flower in his buttonhole, came out on
the porch as Barres and his guests descended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Garry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re home at
last! But you&#8217;re rather late for the fishing.&#8221; And
to Westmore:</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Jim? Jolly to have you back! But
I regret to inform you that the fishing is very poor
just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His son, who stood an inch or two taller than his
debonaire parent, passed one arm around his shoulders
and patted them affectionately while the easy presentations
were concluded.</p>
<p>At the same moment two women, <ins title='Was beautifuly'>beautifully</ins> mounted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
and very wet, galloped up to the porch and welcomed
Garry&#8217;s guests from their saddles in the pleasant, informal,
incurious manner characteristic of Foreland
Farm folk&mdash;a manner which seemed too amiably certain
of itself to feel responsibility for anybody or
anything else.</p>
<p>Easy, unconcerned, slender and clean-built women
these&mdash;Mrs. Reginald Barres, Garry&#8217;s mother, and her
daughter, Lee. And in their smart, rain-wet riding
clothes they might easily have been sisters, with a few
years&#8217; difference between them, so agreeably had Time
behaved toward Mrs. Barres, so closely her fair-haired,
fair-skinned daughter resembled her.</p>
<p>They swung carelessly out of their saddles and set
spurred foot to turf, and, with Garret and his guests,
sauntered into the big living hall, where a maid waited
with wine and biscuits and the housekeeper lingered to
conduct Thessalie and Dulcie to their rooms.</p>
<p>Dulcie Soane, in her pretty travelling gown, walked
beside Mrs. Reginald Barres into the first great house
she had ever entered. Composed, but shyly enchanted,
an odd but delightful sensation possessed her that she
was where she belonged&mdash;that such environment, such
people should always have been familiar to her&mdash;were
logical and familiar to her now.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barres was saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you like parties, there is always gaiety at
Northbrook. But you don&#8217;t have to go anywhere or
do anything you don&#8217;t wish to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie said, diffidently, that she liked everything,
and Mrs. Barres laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll be very popular,&#8221; she said, tossing her
riding crop onto the table and stripping off her wet
gloves.</p>
<p>Barres senior was already in serious confab with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
Westmore concerning piscatorial conditions, the natural
low water of midsummer, the capricious conduct
of the trout in the streams and in the upper and lower
lakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t look at anything until sunset,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;and then they don&#8217;t mean business. You&#8217;ll
see, Jim. I&#8217;m sorry; you should have come in June.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee, Garret&#8217;s boyishly slim sister, had already begun
to exchange opinions about horses with Thessalie,
for both had been familiar with the saddle since childhood,
though the latter&#8217;s Cossack horsemanship and
mastery of the haute école, incident to her recent and
irregular profession, might have astonished Lee Barres.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barres was saying to Dulcie:</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t try to entertain one another here, but
everybody seems to have a perfectly good time. The
main thing is that we all feel quite free at Foreland.
You&#8217;ll lose yourself indoors at first. The family for
a hundred years has been adding these absurd two-story
wings, so that the house wanders at random over
the landscape, and you may have to inquire your way
about in the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled again at Dulcie and took her hand in
both of hers:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will like the Farms,&#8221; she said, linking
her other arm through her son&#8217;s. &#8220;I&#8217;m rather wet,
Garry,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but I think Lee and I had better
dry out in the saddle.&#8221; And to Dulcie again: &#8220;Tea
at five, if anybody wishes it. Would you like to see
your room?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie, conversing with Lee, turned smilingly to
be included in the suggestion; and the maid came forward
to conduct her and Dulcie through the intricacies
of the big, casual, sprawling house, where rooms and
corridors and halls rambled unexpectedly and irrelevantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
in every direction, and one vista seemed to terminate
in another.</p>
<p>When they had disappeared, the Barres family
turned to inspect its son and heir with habitual and
humorous insouciance, commenting frankly upon his
personal appearance and concluding that his health
still remained all that could be desired by the most solicitous
of parents and sisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are rods already rigged up in the work-room,&#8221;
remarked his father, &#8220;if you and your guests
care to try a dry-fly this evening. As for me, you&#8217;ll
find me somewhere around the upper lake, if you care
to look for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He fished out of his pocket a bewildering tangle of
fine mist-leaders, and, leisurely disentangling them,
strolled toward the porch, still talking:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one fly they deign to notice, now&mdash;a
dust-coloured midge tied in reverse with no hackle,
no tinsel, a May-fly tail, and barred canary wing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He nodded wisely over his shoulder at his son and
Westmore, as though sharing with them a delightful
secret of world-wide importance, and continued on
toward the porch, serenely interested in his tangled
leaders.</p>
<p>Garret glanced at his mother and sister; they both
laughed. He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad is one of those rarest of modern beings, a genuine
angler of the old school. After all the myriad
trout and salmon he has caught in a career devoted to
fishing, the next fish he catches gives him just as fine
a thrill as did the very first one he ever hooked! It&#8217;s
quite wonderful, isn&#8217;t it, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably what keeps him so youthful,&#8221; remarked
Westmore. &#8220;The thing to do is to have something
to do. That&#8217;s the elixir of youth. Look at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
your mother, Garry. She&#8217;s had a busy handful bringing
you up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Garret looked at his slender, attractive mother and
laughed again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what keeps you so young and pretty,
mother?&mdash;looking after me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, Garry, I&#8217;m over forty, and I look it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&mdash;you sweet little thing!&#8221; he interrupted,
picking her up suddenly from the floor and marching
proudly around the room with her. &#8220;Gaze upon my
mother, Jim! Isn&#8217;t she cunning? Isn&#8217;t she the smartest
little thing in America? Behave yourself, mother!
Your grateful son is showing you off to the appreciative
young gentleman from New York&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ridiculous! Jim! Make him put me down!&#8221;</p>
<p>But her tall son swung her to his shoulder and placed
her high on the mantel shelf over the huge fireplace;
where she sat beside the clock, charming, resentful,
but helpless, her spurred boots dangling down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Lee!&#8221; cried her brother, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
put you up beside her. That mantel needs ornamental
bric-a-brac and objets d&#8217;art&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee turned to escape, but her brother cornered and
caught her, and swung her high, seating her beside his
indignant mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as though we were two Angora kittens,&#8221; remarked
Lee, sidling along the stone shelf toward her
mother. Then she glanced out through the open front
door. &#8220;Lift us down, quick, Garry. You&#8217;d better!
The horses are in the flower beds and there&#8217;ll be no
more bouquets for the table in another minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>So he lifted them off the mantel and they hastily
departed, each administering correction with her riding
crop as she dodged past him and escaped.</p>
<p>&#8220;If your guests want horses you know where to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
them!&#8221; called back his sister from the porch. And
presently she and his mother, securely mounted, went
cantering away across country, where grass and fern
and leaf and blossom were glistening in the rising
breeze, weighted down with diamond drops of rain.</p>
<p>Westmore walked leisurely toward his quarters, to
freshen up and don knickers. Garret followed him into
the west wing, whistling contentedly under his breath,
inspecting each remembered object with great content
as he passed, nodding smilingly to the servants he encountered,
lingering on the landing to acknowledge the
civilities of the ancient family cat, who recognised him
with effusion but coyly fled the advances of Westmore,
ignoring all former and repeated introductions.</p>
<p>Their rooms adjoined and they conversed through
the doorway while engaged in ablutions.</p>
<p>Presently, from behind his sheer sash-curtains, Westmore
caught sight of Thessalie on the west terrace below.
She wore a shell-pink frock and a most distractingly
pretty hat; and he hurried his dressing as much
as he could without awaking Garret&#8217;s suspicions.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, radiant in white flannels, he
appeared on the terrace, breathing rather fast but
wreathed in persuasive smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know this place; I&#8217;ll take you for a walk where
you won&#8217;t get your shoes wet. Shall I?&#8221; he suggested,
with all his guile and cunning quite plain to Thessalie,
and his purpose perfectly transparent to her smiling
eyes.</p>
<p>But she consented prettily, and went with him without
demurring, picking her way over the stepping-stone
walk with downcast gaze and the trace of a smile on
her lips&mdash;a smile as delicately indefinable as the fancy
which moved her to accept this young man&#8217;s headlong
advances&mdash;which had recognized them and accepted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
them from the first. But why, she did not even yet
understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreeable weather, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Westmore, fatuously
revealing his present paucity of ideas apart from
those which concerned the wooing of her. And he was
an intelligent young man at that, and a sculptor of
attainment, too. But now, in his infatuated head,
there remained room only for one thought, the thought
of this girl who walked so demurely and daintily beside
him over the flat, grass-set stepping stones toward
the three white pines on the little hill.</p>
<p>For it had been something or other at first sight with
Westmore&mdash;love, perhaps&mdash;anyway that is what he
called the mental chaos which now disorganised him.
And it was certain that something happened to him the
first time he laid eyes on Thessalie Dunois. He knew
it, and she could not avoid seeing it, so entirely naïve
his behaviour, so utterly guileless his man&oelig;uvres, so
direct, unfeigned and childish his methods of approach.</p>
<p>At moments she felt nervous and annoyed by his
behaviour; at other times apprehensive and helpless,
as though she were responsible for something that did
not know how to take care of itself&mdash;something immature,
irrational, and entirely at her mercy. And it
may have been the feminine response to this increasing
sense of obligation&mdash;the confused instinct to guide, admonish
and protect&mdash;that began being the matter with
her.</p>
<p>Anyway, from the beginning the man had a certain
fascination for her, unwillingly divined on her part, yet
specifically agreeable even to the point of exhilaration.
Also, somehow or other, the girl realised he had a brain.</p>
<p>And yet he was a pitiably hopeless case; for even
now he was saying such things as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure that your feet are dry? I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
should never forgive myself, Thessa, if you took cold....
Are you tired?... How wonderful it is to be
here alone with you, and strive to interpret the mystery
of your mind and heart! Sit here under the pines.
I&#8217;ll spread my coat for you.... Nature is wonderful,
isn&#8217;t it, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>And when she gravely consented to seat herself he
dropped recklessly onto the wet pine needles at her
feet, and spoke with imbecile delight again of nature&mdash;of
how wonderful were its protean manifestations,
and how its beauties were not meant to be enjoyed
alone but in mystic communion with another who understood.</p>
<p>It was curious, too, but this stuff seemed to appeal
to her, some commonplace chord within her evidently
responding. She sighed and looked at the mountains.
They really were miracles of colour&mdash;masses of purest
cobalt, now, along the horizon.</p>
<p>But perhaps the trite things they uttered did not
really matter; probably it made no difference to them
what they said. And even if he had murmured:
&#8220;There are milestones along the road to Dover,&#8221; she
might have responded: &#8220;There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe&#8221;; and neither of them would have
heard anything at all except the rapid, confused, and
voiceless conversation of two youthful human hearts
beating out endless questions and answers that never
moved their smiling lips. There was the mystery, if
any&mdash;the constant wireless current under the haphazard
flow of words.</p>
<p>There was no wind in the pines; meadow and pasture,
woodland and swale stretched away at their feet
to the distant, dark-blue hills. And all around them
hung the rain-washed fragrance of midsummer under
a still, cloudless sky.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It seems impossible that there can be war anywhere
in the world,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; he began, &#8220;it&#8217;s getting on my nerves
the way those swine from the Rhine are turning this
decent green world into a bloody wallow! Unless we
do something about it pretty soon, I think I&#8217;ll go
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To France.&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained silent for a while, merely lifting her
dark eyes to him at intervals; then she grew preoccupied
with other thoughts that left her brows bent
slightly inward and her mouth very grave.</p>
<p>He gazed reflectively out over the fields and woods:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I can&#8217;t stand it much longer,&#8221; he mused aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do there?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything. I could drive a car. But if they&#8217;ll
take me in some Canadian unit&mdash;or one of the Foreign
Legions&mdash;it would suit me.... You know a man can&#8217;t
go on just living in the world while this beastly business
continues&mdash;can&#8217;t go on eating and sleeping and
shaving and dressing as though half of civilisation were
not rolling in agony and blood, stabbed through and
through&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice caught&mdash;he checked himself and slowly
passed his hand over his smoothly shaven face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those splendid poilus,&#8221; he said; &#8220;where they stand
we Americans ought to be standing, too.... God
knows why we hesitate.... I can&#8217;t tell you what we
think.... Some of us&mdash;don&#8217;t agree&mdash;with the Administration.&#8221;</p>
<p>His jaws snapped on the word; he stared out through
the sunshine at the swallows, now skimming the uncut
hay fields in their gusty evening flight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are you really going?&#8221; she asked, at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll wait a little while longer to see what my
country is going to do. If it doesn&#8217;t stir during the
next month or two, I shall go. I think Garry will go,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;we&#8217;d prefer our own
flag, Garry and I. But if it is to remain furled&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He shrugged, picked a spear of grass, and sat brooding
and breaking it into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that troubles me,&#8221; he went on presently,
keeping his gaze riveted on his busy fingers, &#8220;the
only thing that worries me is you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; she exclaimed softly. And an inexplicable
little thrill shot through her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;You worry me to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>She considered him a moment, her lips parted as
though she were about to say something, but it remained
unsaid, and a slight colour came into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to do about you?&#8221; he went on, apparently
addressing the blade of grass he was staring at.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave you as matters stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, you are not responsible for me, are you?&#8221;
And tried to laugh, but scarcely smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I desire to be entirely&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. You have been more than kind. And
very soon I hope I shall be on happy terms with my
own Government again. Then your solicitude should
cease.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your Government listens to reason&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I also could go to France!&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;Merely to think of it excites me beyond words!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up quickly:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You wish to go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you ask that! If you had been a disgraced
exile as I have been, as I still am&mdash;and falsely
accused of shameful things&mdash;annoyed, hounded, blackmailed,
offered bribes, constantly importuned to become
what I am not&mdash;a traitor to my own people&mdash;would
you not be wildly happy to be proven innocent?
Would you not be madly impatient to return and prove
your devotion to your own land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you understand. Do you imagine that
I, a French girl, would have remained here in shameful
security if I could have gone back to France and
helped? I would have done anything&mdash;anything, I
tell you&mdash;scrubbed the floors of hospitals, worked my
fingers to the bone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait till you go,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;They&#8217;ll clear
your record very soon, I expect. I&#8217;ll wait. And we&#8217;ll
go together. Shall we, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she had not seemed to hear him; her dark eyes
grew remote, her gaze swept the sapphire distance.
It was his hand laid lightly over hers that aroused her,
and she withdrew her fingers with a frown of remonstrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me speak?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
let me tell you what my heart tells me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t desire to hear yet&mdash;I don&#8217;t know where my
own heart&mdash;or even my mind is&mdash;or what I think about&mdash;anything.
Please be reasonable.&#8221; She stole a look
at him to see how he was taking it, and there was concern
enough in her glance to give him a certain amount
of hope had he noticed it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You like me, Thessa, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I not admitted it? Do you know that you
are becoming a serious responsibility to me? You
worry me, too! You are like a boy with all your emotions
reflected on your features and every thought perfectly
unconcealed and every impulse followed by unconsidered
behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be reasonable. I have asked it a hundred times
of you in vain. I shall ask it, probably, innumerable
times before you comply with my request. Don&#8217;t show
so plainly that you imagine yourself in love. It embarrasses
me, it annoys Garry, and I don&#8217;t know what
his family will think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I <i>am</i> in love, why not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does one advertise all one&#8217;s most intimate and secret
and&mdash;and sacred emotions?&#8221; she interrupted in
sudden and breathless annoyance. &#8220;It is not the way
that successful courtship is conducted, I warn you!
It is not delicate, it is not considerate, it is not sensible....
And I <i>do</i> want you to&mdash;to be always&mdash;sensible
and considerate. I <i>want</i> to like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in a sort of dazed way:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to please you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it seems to
confuse me&mdash;being so suddenly bowled over&mdash;a thing
like that rather knocks a man out&mdash;so unexpected, you
know!&mdash;and there isn&#8217;t much use pretending,&#8221; he went
on excitedly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see anybody else in the world
except you! I can&#8217;t think of anybody else! I&#8217;m
madly in love&mdash;blindly, desperately&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, <i>please</i>!&#8221; she remonstrated. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
a girl to be taken by storm! I&#8217;ve seen too much&mdash;lived
too much! I&#8217;m not a Tzigane to be galloped
alongside of and swung to a man&#8217;s saddle-bow! Also,
I shall tell you one thing more. Happiness and laughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
are necessities to me! And they seem to be becoming
extinct in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it!&#8221; he demanded tragically, &#8220;how can I
laugh when I&#8217;m in love!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that a sudden, irresponsible little peal of laughter
parted her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you <i>are</i> funny! Is it a matter
of prayer and fasting, then, this gloomy sentiment
which you say you entertain for me? I don&#8217;t know
whether to be flattered or vexed&mdash;you are <i>so</i> funny!&#8221;
And her laughter rang out again, clear and uncontrolled.</p>
<p>The girl was quite irresistible in her care-free gaiety;
her lovely face and delicious laughter no man
could utterly withstand, and presently a faint grin
became visible on his features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she cried gaily, &#8220;you are becoming human
and not a Grecian mask or a gargoyle! Remain so,
mon ami, if you expect me to wish you good luck
in your love&mdash;your various affairs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She blushed
as she checked herself. But he said very quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you wish me luck, Thessa, in my various love
affairs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many have you on hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly one. Do you wish me a sporting chance?
Do you, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you wish me good luck in my courtship of
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The quick colour again swept her cheeks at that,
but she laughed defiantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wish you luck in that, also.
Only remember this&mdash;whether you win or lose you must
laugh. <i>That</i> is good sportsmanship. Do you promise?
Very well! Then I wish you the best of luck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
in your&mdash;various&mdash;courtships! And may the girl you
win at least know how to laugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly does,&#8221; he said so naïvely that they
both gave way to laughter again, finding each other
delightfully absurd.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the key to my heart, laughter&mdash;in case you are
looking for the key,&#8221; she said daringly. &#8220;The world
is a grim scaffold, mon ami; mount it gaily and go
to the far gods laughing. Tell me, is there a better
way to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s the right way, Thessa. I shan&#8217;t be a
gloom any more. Come on; let&#8217;s walk! What if you
do get your bally shoes wet! I&#8217;m through mooning
and fussing and worrying over you, young lady!
You&#8217;re as sturdy and vigorous as I am. After all,
it&#8217;s a comrade a man wants in the world&mdash;not a white
mouse in cotton batting! Come! Are you going for
a brisk walk across country? Or are you a white
mouse?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood up in her dainty shoes and frail gown
and cast a glance of hurt reproach at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be brutal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not dressed to
climb trees and fences with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t come?&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eyes met in silent conflict for a few moments.
Then she said: &#8220;Please don&#8217;t make me.... It&#8217;s such
a darling gown, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wave of deep happiness enveloped him and he
laughed: &#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t ask you to
spoil your frock!&#8221; And he spread his coat on the pine
needles for her once more.</p>
<p>She considered the situation for a few moments before
she sat down. But she did seat herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we are going to discuss a situation.
This is the situation: I am deeply in love. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
you&#8217;re quite right, it&#8217;s no funeral; it&#8217;s a joyous thing
to be in love. It&#8217;s a delight, a gaiety, a happy enchantment.
Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She cast a rather shy and apprehensive glance at
him, but nodded slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m in love, and I&#8217;m happy
and proud to be in love. What I wish then, naturally,
is marriage, a home, children&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t have &#8217;em! Why? Because I&#8217;m going
to France. And the girl I wish to marry is going also.
And while I bang away at the boche she makes herself
useful in canteens, rest-houses, hospitals, orphanages,
everywhere, in fact, where she is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And after it&#8217;s all over&mdash;all over&mdash;and ended&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then if she finds out that she loves me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jim&mdash;if she finds that out.... And thank
you for&mdash;asking me&mdash;so sweetly.&#8221;... She turned
sharply and looked out over a valley suddenly blurred.</p>
<p>For it had been otherwise with her in years gone
by, and men had spoken then quite as plainly but differently.
Only d&#8217;Eblis, burnt out, done for, and obsessed,
had wearily and unwillingly advanced that far.... And
Ferez, too; but that was unthinkable of a
creature in whom virtue and vice were of the same virus.</p>
<p>Looking blindly out over the valley she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If my Government deals justly with me, then I
shall go to France with you as your comrade. If I
ever find that I love you I will be your wife.... Until
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stretched out her hand, not looking
around at him; and they exchanged a quick, firm
clasp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>And so matters progressed between, these two&mdash;rather
ominously for Barres, in case he entertained
any really serious sentiments in regard to Thessalie.
And, recently, he had been vaguely conscious that he
entertained something or other concerning the girl
which caused him to look with slight amazement and
unsympathetic eyes upon the all too obvious behaviour
of his comrade Westmore.</p>
<p>At present he was standing in the summer house
which terminated the blossoming tunnel of the rose arbour,
watching water falling into a stone basin from
the fishy mouth of a wall fountain, and wondering
where Thessalie and Westmore had gone.</p>
<p>Dulcie, in a thin white frock and leghorn hat, roaming
entranced and at hazard over lawn and through
shrubbery and garden, encountered him there, still
squinting abstractedly at the water spout.</p>
<p>It was the first time the girl had seen him since their
arrival at Foreland Farms. And now, as she paused
under the canopy of fragrant rain-drenched roses and
looked at this man who had made all this possible for
her, she suddenly felt the change within herself, fitting
her for it all&mdash;a subtle metamorphosis completing
itself within her&mdash;the final accomplishment of a
transmutation, deep, radical, permanent.</p>
<p>For her, the stark, starved visage which Life had
worn had relaxed; in the grim, forbidding wall which
had closed her horizon, a door opened, showing a corner
of a world where she knew, somehow, she belonged.</p>
<p>And in her heart, too, a door seemed to open, and
her youthful soul stepped out of it, naked, fearless,
quite certain of itself and, for the first time during
their brief and earthly partnership, quite certain of
the body wherein it dwelt.</p>
<p>He was thinking of Thessalie when Dulcie came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
up and stood beside him, looking down into the water
where a few goldfish swam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Sweetness,&#8221; he said, brightening, &#8220;you look
very wonderful in white, with that big hat on your very
enchanting red hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel both wonderful and enchanted,&#8221; she said,
lifting her eyes. &#8220;I shall live in the country some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; he said smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I earn enough money. Do you remember
the crazy way Strindberg rolls around? Well, I
feel like doing it on that lawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and do it,&#8221; he urged. But she only
laughed and chased the goldfish around the basin with
gentle fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re unfolding, you&#8217;re blossoming,
you&#8217;re developing feminine snap and go and
pep and je-ne-sais-quoi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re teasing. But I believe I&#8217;m very feminine&mdash;and
mature&mdash;though you don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re exactly at an age called
well-preserved,&#8221; he said, laughing. He took her hands
and drew her up to confront him. &#8220;You&#8217;re not too
old to have me as a playmate, Sweetness, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to be doubtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Nonsense! And you&#8217;re not too old to be
bullied and coaxed and petted&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not too old to pose for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She grew pink and looked down at the submerged
goldfish. And, keeping her eyes there:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to ask you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;how much longer
you think you would require me&mdash;that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence. Then she looked at him out
of her frank grey eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ll do what you wish,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
I know it is quite all right....&#8221; She smiled at him.
&#8220;I belong to you: you made me.... And you know
all about me. So you ought to use me as you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to pose?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, except&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you annoyed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Sweetness. It&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are annoyed&mdash;disappointed! And I won&#8217;t
have it. I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t stand it&mdash;to have you displeased&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He said pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not displeased, Dulcie. And there&#8217;s no use
discussing it. If you have the slightest feeling that
way, when we go back to town I&#8217;ll do things like the
Arethusa from somebody else&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t!&#8221; she exclaimed in such naïve alarm
that he began to laugh and she blushed vividly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are feminine, all right!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If it
isn&#8217;t to be you it isn&#8217;t to be anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that.... <i>Yes</i>, I did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dulcie! Shame! <i>You</i> jealous!&mdash;even to the
verge of sacrificing your own feelings&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I&#8217;d rather you used
me for your Arethusa. You know,&#8221; she added wistfully,
&#8220;that we began it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, Sweetness. And we&#8217;ll finish it together or
not at all. Are you satisfied?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, sighed, nodded. He released her lovely,
childlike hands and she walked to the doorway of the
summer house and looked out over the wall-bed, where
tall thickets of hollyhock and blue larkspur stretched
away in perspective toward a grove of trees and a little
pond beyond.</p>
<p>His painter&#8217;s eye, already busy with the beauty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
her face and figure against the riot of flowers, and
almost mechanically transposing both into terms of
colour and value, went blind suddenly as she turned
and looked at him.</p>
<p>And for the first time&mdash;perhaps with truer vision&mdash;he
became aware of what else this young girl was
besides a satisfying combination of tint and contour&mdash;this
lithe young thing palpitating with life&mdash;this
slender, gently breathing girl with her grey eyes meeting
his so candidly&mdash;this warm young human being
who belonged more truly in the living scheme of things
than she did on painted canvas or in marble.</p>
<p>From this unexpected angle, and suddenly, he found
himself viewing her for the first time&mdash;not as a plaything,
not as a petted model, not as an object appealing
to his charity, not as an experiment in altruism&mdash;nor
sentimentally either, nor as a wistful child without
a childhood.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to him, she had once been all of these. He
looked at her with other eyes now, beginning, possibly,
to realise something of the terrific responsibility he
was so lightly assuming.</p>
<p>He got up from his bench and went over to her;
and the girl turned a trifle pale with excitement and
delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you come to me?&#8221; she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know I was trying to make you get up
and come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Isn&#8217;t it curious? I looked at you and kept
thinking, &#8216;I want you to get up and come to me! I
want you to <i>come</i>! I <i>want</i> you!&#8217; And suddenly you
got up and came!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her out of curious, unsmiling eyes:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your turn, after all, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it my turn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I drew you&mdash;in the beginning,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>There was a silence. Then, abruptly, her heart
began to beat very rapidly, scaring her dumb with its
riotous behaviour. When at length her consternation
subsided and her irregular breathing became composed,
she said, quite calmly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You and all that you are and believe in and care
for very naturally attracted me&mdash;drew me one evening
to your open door.... It will always be the
same&mdash;you, and what of life and knowledge you represent&mdash;will
never fail to draw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;though I am just beginning to divine it&mdash;you
also drew <i>me</i>, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did. You do still. I am just waking up to
that fact. And that starts me wondering what I&#8217;d
do without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do without me,&#8221; she said, instinctively
laying her hand over her heart; it was beating
so hard and, she feared, so loud. &#8220;You can always
have me when you wish. You know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a while, yes. But some day, when&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed without knowing why.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll marry some day, Sweetness,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes you will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she only looked away and shook her head. And
the silent motion of dissent gave him an odd sense of
relief.</p>

</div>
<p>With the decline of day came enough of a
chill to spin a delicate cobweb of mist across
the country and cover forests and hills with
a bluish bloom.</p>
<p>The sunset had become a splashy crimson affair, perhaps
a bit too theatrical. In the red blaze Thessalie
and Westmore came wandering down from the three
pines on the hill, and found Barres on the lawn scowling
at the celestial conflagration in the west, and Dulcie
seated near on the fountain rim, silent, distrait,
watching the scarlet ripples spreading from the plashing
central jet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t paint a thing like that, Garry,&#8221; remarked
Westmore. Barres looked around:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to. Where have you been, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under those pines over there. We supposed you&#8217;d
see us and come up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres glanced at her with an inscrutable expression;
Dulcie&#8217;s grey eyes rested on Barres. Thessalie
walked over to the reddened pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a prophecy of blood, that water,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And over there the world is in flames.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Western World,&#8221; added Westmore, &#8220;I hope
it&#8217;s an omen that we shall soon catch fire. How long
are you going to wait, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres started to answer, but checked himself, and
glanced across at Dulcie without knowing exactly why.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said irresolutely. &#8220;I&#8217;m fed up
now.... But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he continued to look vaguely at
Dulcie, as though something of his uncertainty remotely
concerned her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go over when you are,&#8221; remarked
Westmore, placidly smiling at Thessalie, who immediately
presented her pretty profile to him and settled
down on the fountain rim beside Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s about time to dress. Are
you going to wear that enchanting white affair we discovered
at <ins title="Was Mendel's">Mandel&#8217;s</ins>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres senior came sauntering out of the woods and
through the wall gate, switching a limber rod reflectively.
He obligingly opened his creel and displayed
half a dozen long, slim trout.</p>
<p>&#8220;They all took that midge fly I described to you this
afternoon,&#8221; he said, with the virtuous satisfaction of
all prophets.</p>
<p>Everybody inspected the crimson-flecked fish while
Barres senior stood twirling his monocle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we dining at home?&#8221; inquired his son.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so. There is a guest of honour, if I recollect&mdash;some
fellow they&#8217;re lionising&mdash;I don&#8217;t remember....
And one or two others&mdash;the Gerhardts, I
believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better dress, I think,&#8221; said Thessalie,
encircling Dulcie&#8217;s waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; said Barres senior, &#8220;hoped to take you
young ladies out on the second lake and let you try
for a big fish this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked across the lawn beside them, switching his
rod as complacently as a pleased cat twitches its tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it to-morrow evening,&#8221; he continued reassuringly,
as though all their most passionate hopes
had been bound up in the suggested sport; &#8220;it&#8217;s rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
annoying&mdash;I can&#8217;t remember who&#8217;s dining with us&mdash;some
celebrated Irishman&mdash;poet of sorts&mdash;literary
chap&mdash;guest of the Gerhardts&mdash;neighbours, you know.
It&#8217;s a nuisance to bother with dinner when the trout
rise only after sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever dine willingly, Mr. Barres, while
the trout are rising?&#8221; inquired Thessalie, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never willingly,&#8221; he replied in a perfectly sincere
voice. &#8220;I prefer to remain near the water and have
a bit of supper when I return.&#8221; He smiled at Thessalie
indulgently. &#8220;No doubt it amuses you, but I
wager that you and little Miss Soane here will feel
exactly as I do after you&#8217;ve caught your first big
trout.&#8221;</p>
<p>They entered the house together, followed by Garry
and Westmore.</p>
<p>A dim, ruddy glow still lingered in the quiet rooms;
every window glass was still lighted by the sun&#8217;s smouldering
ashes sinking in the west; no lamps had yet
been lighted on the ground floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the magic hour on the water,&#8221; Barres senior
confided to Dulcie, &#8220;and here I am, doomed to a stiff
shirt and table talk. In other words, nailed!&#8221; And
he gave her a mysterious, melancholy, but significant
look as though she alone were really fitted to understand
the distressing dilemmas of an angler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be too late to fish after dinner?&#8221; ventured
Dulcie. &#8220;I&#8217;d love to go with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you, really!&#8221; he exclaimed, warmly grateful.
&#8220;That is the spirit I admire in a girl! It&#8217;s human,
it&#8217;s discriminating! And yet, do you know, nobody
except myself in this household seems to care
very much about angling? And, actually, I don&#8217;t believe
there is another soul in this entire house who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
would care to miss dinner for the sake of landing the
finest trout in the second lake!&mdash;unless you would?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really would!&#8221; said Dulcie, smiling. &#8220;Please try
me, Mr. Barres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I shall! I&#8217;ll give you one of my pet rods,
too! I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The rich, metallic murmur of a temple gong broke
out in the dim quiet of the house. It was the dressing
bell.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk it over at dinner&mdash;if they&#8217;ll let me sit
by you,&#8221; whispered Barres senior. And with the smile
and the cautionary gesture of the true conspirator, he
went away in the demi-light.</p>
<p>Thessalie came from the bay window, where she had
been with Westmore and Garry, and she and Dulcie
walked away toward the staircase hall, leisurely followed
by the two men who, however, turned again into
the western wing.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dulcie was the first to reappear and descend the
stairs of the north wing&mdash;a willowy white shape in the
early dusk, slim as a young spirit in the lamplit silence.</p>
<p>Nobody else had come down; a maid was turning
up a lamp here and there; the plebeian family cat came
out of the shadows from somewhere and made advances
as though divining that this quiet stranger was a
friend to cats.</p>
<p>So Dulcie stooped to pet her, then wandered on
through the place and finally into the music room, where
she seated herself at the piano and touched the keys
softly in the semi-dusk.</p>
<p>Among the songs&mdash;words and music&mdash;which her
mother had left in manuscript, was one which she had
learned recently,&mdash;&#8220;Blue Eyes&#8221;&mdash;and she played the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
air now, seated there all alone in the subdued lamp
light.</p>
<p>Presently people began to appear from above&mdash;Mrs.
Barres, who motioned her not to rise, and who seated
herself near, watching the girl&#8217;s slender fingers moving
on the keys; then Lee, who came and stood beside
her, followed in a few moments by Thessalie and the
two younger men.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that lovely little air you are playing?&#8221;
inquired Mrs. Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is called &#8216;Blue Eyes,&#8217;&#8221; said Dulcie, absently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never before heard it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my mother wrote it.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a silence:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is really exquisite,&#8221; said Mrs. Barres. &#8220;Are
there words to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people had come into the entrance hall beyond;
there was the low whirring of an automobile
outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my mother made some verses for it,&#8221; replied
Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you sing them for me after dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I shall be happy to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Barres turned to welcome her new guests, now
entering the music room convoyed by Barres senior, who
was arrayed in the dreaded &#8220;stiff shirt&#8221; and already
indulging in &#8220;table talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They took,&#8221; he was explaining, &#8220;a midge-fly with
no hackle&mdash;Claire, here are the Gerhardts and Mr.
Skeel!&#8221; And while his wife welcomed them and introductions
were effected, he continued explaining the construction
of the midge to anybody who listened.</p>
<p>At the first mention of Murtagh Skeel&#8217;s name, the
glances of Westmore, Garry and Thessalie crossed like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
lightning, then their attention became riveted on this
tall, graceful, romantic looking man of early middle
age, who was being lionised at Northbrook.</p>
<p>The next moment Garry stepped back beside Dulcie
Soane, who had turned white as a flower and was
gazing at Skeel as though she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he can be the same man your
mother knew?&#8221; he whispered, dropping his arm and
taking her trembling hand in a firm clasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.... I seem to feel so.... I can&#8217;t
explain to you how it pierced my heart&mdash;the sound
of his name.... Oh, Garry!&mdash;suppose it is true&mdash;that
he is the man my mother knew&mdash;and cared for!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he could speak, cocktails were served, and
Adolf Gerhardt, a large, bearded, pompous man, engaged
him in explosive conversation:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, this fellow Corot Mandel is producing a new
spectacle-play on my lawn to-morrow evening. Your
family and your guests are invited, of course. And
for the dance, also&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He included Dulcie in a
pompous bow, finished his cocktail with another flourish:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find my friend Skeel very attractive,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;You know who he is?&mdash;<i>the</i> Murtagh Skeel
who writes those Irish poems of the West Coast&mdash;and
is not, I believe, very well received in England
just now&mdash;a matter of nationalism&mdash;patriotism, eh?
Why should it surprise your Britisher, eh?&mdash;if a gentleman
like Murtagh Skeel displays no sympathy for
England?&mdash;if a gentleman like my friend, Sir Roger
Casement, prefers to live in Germany?&#8221;</p>
<p>Garry, under his own roof, said pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do for us to discuss those things, I
fear, Mr. Gerhardt. And your Irish lion seems to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
be very gentle and charming. He must be fascinating
to women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gerhardt threw up his hands:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord! They would like to eat him! Or be
eaten by him! You know? It is that way always
between the handsome poet and the sex. Which eats
which is of no consequence, so long as they merge.
Eh?&#8221; And his thunderous laughter set the empty
glasses faintly ringing on the butler&#8217;s silver tray.</p>
<p>Garry spoke to Mrs. Gerhardt, a large, pallid,
slabby German who might have been somebody&#8217;s
kitchen maid, but had been born a <i>von</i>.</p>
<p>Later, as dinner was announced, he contrived to
speak to Thessalie aside:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gerhardt,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t recognise you,
of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not at all apprehensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, it was on his yacht&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never even looked twice at me. You know what
he thought me to be? Very well, he had only social
ambitions then. I think that&#8217;s all he has now. You
see what he got with his Red Eagle,&#8221; nodding calmly
toward Mrs. Gerhardt, who now was being convoyed
out by the monocled martyr in the &#8220;stiff shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others passed out informally; Lee had slipped
her arm around Dulcie. As Garry and Thessalie
turned to follow, he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel quite secure, then, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>She halted, put her lips close to his ear, unnoticed
by those ahead:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly. The Gerhardts are what you call fatheads&mdash;easily
used by anybody, dangerous to no one,
governed by greed alone, without a knowledge of any
honour except the German sort. But that Irish
dreamer over there, <i>he</i> is dangerous! That type always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
is. He menaces the success of any enterprise
to which his quixotic mind turns, because it instantly
becomes a fixed idea with him&mdash;an obsession, a monomania!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took his arm and walked on beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that fascinating, hot-headed, lovable type
of mystic visionary,&#8221; she said, &#8220;handsome, romantic,
illogical, governed entirely by emotion, not fickle
yet never to be depended on; not faithless, but absolutely
irresponsible and utterly ignorant of fear!...
My father was that sort. <i>Not</i> the hunting cheetah
Cyril and Ferez pretended. And it was in <i>defence</i> of
a woman that my father died.... Thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Renoux&mdash;the other night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad, Thessa!&#8221;</p>
<p>She held her flushed head high and smiled at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, &#8220;after all it is in my blood
to be decent.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The Gerhardts, racially vulgar and socially blunt&mdash;for
the inherent vulgarity of the Teutonic peoples
is an axiom among the civilised&mdash;made themselves characteristically
conspicuous at the flower-laden table;
but it was on Murtagh Skeel that all eyes became ultimately
focused to the limit of good-breeding. He was
the lode-star&mdash;he was the magnet, the vanishing point
for all curiosity, all surmises, all interest.</p>
<p>Perfect breeding, perfect unconsciousness of self,
were his minted marks to guarantee the fineness of his
metal. He was natural without effort, winning in
voice, in manner, in grace of mind and body, this fascinating
Irishman of letters&mdash;a charming listener, a
persuasive speaker, modest, light hearted, delightfully
deferential.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>Seated on the right of Mrs. Barres, his smiling
hostess very quickly understood the situation and made
it pleasantly plain to everybody that her guest of
honour was not to be privately monopolised.</p>
<p>So almost immediately all currents of conversation
flowed from all sides toward this dark-eyed, handsome
man, and in return the silver-tongued tide of many
currents&mdash;the Irish Sea at its sparkling flood&mdash;flowed
prettily and spread out from its perennial source within
him, and washed and rippled gently over every separate
dinner plate, so that nobody seemed neglected,
and there was jetsam and beach-combing for all.</p>
<p>And it was inevitable, presently, that Murtagh
Skeel&#8217;s conversation should become autobiographical
in some degree, and his careless, candid, persuasive
phrases turn into little gemlike memories. For he
came ultimately, of course, to speak of Irish nationalism
and what it meant; of the Celt as he had been
and must remain&mdash;utterly unchanged, as long as the
last Celt remained alive on earth.</p>
<p>The subject, naturally, invaded the fairy lore, wild
legend and lovely mysticism of the West Coast; and
centred about his own exquisite work of interpreting it.</p>
<p>He spoke of it very modestly, as his source of inspiration,
as the inception of his own creative work
in that field. But always, through whatever he said,
rang low and clear his passionate patriotism and the
only motive which incited him to creative effort&mdash;his
longing for national autonomy and the re-gathering
of a scattered people in preparation for its massed
journey toward its Destiny.</p>
<p>His voice was musical, his words unconscious poetry.
Without effort, without pains, alas!&mdash;without logic&mdash;he
held every ear enthralled there in the soft candlelight
and subdued glimmer of crystal and of silver.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>His was the magic of shadow and half-lights, of
vague nuances and lost outlines, and the valued degrees
of impinging shade. No sharp contours, no
stark, uncompromising shapes, no brutality of raw
daylight, and&mdash;alas!&mdash;no threat of uncompromising
logic invaded his realm of dreamy demi-lights and faded
fantasies.</p>
<p>He reigned there, amid an enchanted twilight of his
own creation, the embodiment of Irish romance, tender,
gay, sweet-minded, persuasive, gallant&mdash;and
tragic, when, at some unexpected moment, the frail
veil of melancholy made his dark eyes less brilliant.</p>
<p>All yielded to his charm&mdash;even the stuffed Teutons,
gorging gravy; all felt his sway over mind and heart,
nor cared to analyse it, there in the soft light of candles
and the scent of old-fashioned flowers.</p>
<p>There arose some question concerning Sir Roger
Casement.</p>
<p>Murtagh Skeel spoke of him with the pure enthusiasm
of passionate belief in a master by a humble disciple.
And the Teutons grunted assent.</p>
<p>The subject of the war had been politely avoided,
yet, somehow, it came out that Murtagh Skeel had
served in Britain&#8217;s army overseas, as an enlisted man
in some Irish regiment&mdash;a romantic impulse of the
moment, involving a young man&#8217;s crazy plan to foment
rebellion in India. Which little gem of a memoire
presently made the fact of his exile self-explanatory.
Yet, he contrived that the ugly revelation
should end in laughter&mdash;an outbreak of spontaneous
mirth through which his glittering wit passed like
lightning, cauterising the running sore of treason....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Coffee served, the diners drifted whither it suited
them, together or singly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>Like an errant spirit, Dulcie moved about at hazard
amid the softened lights, engaged here, approached
there, pausing, wandering on, nowhere in particular,
yet ever listlessly in motion.</p>
<p>Encountering her near the porch, Barres senior had
paused to whisper that there was no hope for any fishing
that evening; and she had lingered to smile after
him, as, unreconciled, he took his stiff-shirted way
toward the pallid, bejewelled, unanimated mass of Mrs.
Gerhardt, settled in the widest armchair and absorbing
cordial.</p>
<p>A moment later the girl encountered Garry. He
remained with her for a while, evidently desiring to be
near her without finding anything in particular to say.
And when he, in turn, moved elsewhere, obeying some
hazy mandate of hospitality, he became conscious of
a reluctance to leave her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Sweetness,&#8221; he said, lingering, &#8220;that
you wear a delicate beauty to-night lovelier than I
have ever seen in you? You are not only a wonderful
girl, Dulcie; you are growing into an adorable woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked back at him, blushing vividly in her
sheer surprise&mdash;watched him saunter away out of her
silent sphere of influence before she found any word
to utter&mdash;if, indeed, she had been seeking any, so
deeply, so painfully sweet had sunk his words into
every fibre of her untried, defenceless youth.</p>
<p>Now, as her cheeks cooled, and she came to herself
and moved again, there seemed to grow around her a
magic and faintly fragrant radiance through which
she passed&mdash;whither, she paid no heed, so exquisitely
her breast was thrilling under the hurrying pulses of
her little heart.... And presently found herself on
the piano bench, quite motionless, her gaze remote, her
fingers resting on the keys.... And, after a long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
while, she heard an old air stealing through the silence,
and her own voice,&mdash;<i>à demi-voix</i>&mdash;repeating her
mother&#8217;s words:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>I</p>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Were they as wise as they are blue&mdash;</p>

<p>Alas! My heart, to its surprise,</p>
<p>Has learned to look; and now it sighs</p>
<p class='indent2'>For you!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>She became conscious of somebody near, as she
ended. She turned and saw Murtagh Skeel at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
elbow&mdash;saw his agitated, ashen face&mdash;looked beyond
him and discovered other people gathered in the tinted
light beyond, listening; then she lifted her clear, still
gaze again to the white-faced man beside her, and saw
his shaken soul staring at her through the dark windows
of <i>his</i> eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn it?&#8221; he asked with a futile
effort at that control so difficult for any Celt to grasp
where the heart is involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;The song I sang? &#8216;Blue Eyes&#8217;?&#8221; she inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the manuscript of the composer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you tell me where you got it&mdash;and&mdash;and who
wrote those words you sang?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The manuscript came to me from my mother....
She wrote it.... I think you knew her.&#8221;</p>
<p>His strong, handsome hand dropped on the piano&#8217;s
edge, gripped it; and under his pale skin the quick
blood surged to his temples.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your&mdash;your mother&#8217;s name, Miss
Soane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was Eileen Fane.&#8221;</p>
<p>The throbbing seconds passed and still they looked
into each other&#8217;s eyes in silence. And at last:</p>
<p>&#8220;So you did know my mother,&#8221; she said under her
breath; and the hushed finality of her words set his
strong hand trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen&#8217;s little daughter,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Eileen
Fane&#8217;s child.... And grown to womanhood....
Yes, I knew your mother&mdash;many years ago....
When I enlisted and went abroad.... Was it Sir
Terence Soane who married your mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. He stared at her, striving to
concentrate, to think. &#8220;There were other Soanes,&#8221;
he muttered, &#8220;the Ellet Water folk&mdash;no?&mdash;&mdash;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
there were many Soanes among the landed gentry in
the East and North.... I cannot seem to recollect&mdash;the
sudden shock&mdash;hearing a song unexpectedly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His white forehead had grown damp under the curly
hair now clinging to it. He passed his handkerchief
over his brow in a confused way, then leaned heavily
on the piano with both hands grasping it. For the
ghost of his youth was interfering, disputing his control
over his own mind, filling his ear with forgotten
words, taking possession of his memory and tormenting
it with the distant echoes of a voice long dead.</p>
<p>Through the increasing chaos in his brain his
strained gaze sought to fix itself on this living, breathing
face before him&mdash;the child of Eileen Fane.</p>
<p>He made the effort:</p>
<p>&#8220;There were the Soanes of Colross&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But he got
no farther that way, for the twin spectres of his youth
and <i>hers</i> were busy with his senses now; and he leaned
more heavily on the piano, enduring with lowered head
the ghostly whirlwind rushing up out of that obscurity
and darkness where once, under summer skies, he
had sowed a zephyr.</p>
<p>The girl had become rather white, too. One slim
hand still rested on the ivory keys, the other lay inert
in her lap. And after a while she raised her grey
eyes to this man standing beside her:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of my mother&#8217;s marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in a dull way:</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard&mdash;nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that your mother had left Fane Court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was Fane Court?&#8221;</p>
<p>Murtagh Skeel stared at her in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, trembling a little. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
know nothing about my mother. She died when I was
a few months old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t know who your mother
was? You don&#8217;t know who she married?&#8221; he asked,
astounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he said, gazing at her. His tense
features were working now; the battle for self-control
was visible to her, and she sat there dumbly, looking
on at the mute conflict which suddenly sent the tears
flashing into his dark eyes and left his sensitive mouth
twitching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not ask you anything now,&#8221; he said unsteadily;
&#8220;I shall have to see you somewhere else&mdash;where
there are no people&mdash;to interrupt.... But I shall
tell you all I know about&mdash;your mother.... I was
in trouble&mdash;in India. Somehow or other I heard indirectly
that your mother had left Fane Court. Later
it was understood that she had eloped.... Nobody
could tell me the man&#8217;s name.... My people in Ireland
did not know.... And I was not on good terms
with your grandfather. So there was no hope of information
from Fane Court.... I wrote, indeed, begging,
beseeching for news of your mother. Sir Barry&mdash;your
grandfather&mdash;returned my letters unopened....
And that is all I have ever heard concerning
Eileen Fane&mdash;your mother&mdash;with whom I&mdash;fell in love&mdash;nearly
twenty years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dulcie, marble pale, nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you cared for my mother,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you learn it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some letters of hers written to you. Letters from
you to her. I have nothing else of hers except some
verses and little songs&mdash;like the one you recognised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, she wrote it as I sat beside her!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
voice choked, broke, and his lips quivered as he fought
for self-control again.... &#8220;I was not welcome at
Fane Court.... Sir Barry would not tolerate me....
Your mother was more kind.... She was very
young. And so was I, Dulcie.... There were political troubles.
I was always involved. God knows
which was the stronger passion&mdash;it must have been love
of country&mdash;the other seeming hopeless&mdash;with the folk
at Fane Court my bitter enemies&mdash;only excepting your
mother.... So I went away.... And which of the
Soanes your mother eloped with I have never learned....
Now, tell me&mdash;for you surely know that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a man called Soane who tells me sometimes
that he was once a gamekeeper at what he calls
&#8216;the big house.&#8217; I have always supposed him to be
my father until within the last year. But recently,
when he has been drinking heavily, he sometimes tells
me that my name is not Soane but Fane.... Did
you ever know of such a man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There were gamekeepers about.... No. I
cannot recall&mdash;and it is impossible! A gamekeeper!
And your <i>mother</i>! The man is mad! What in God&#8217;s
name does all this mean!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to tremble, and his white forehead under
the clustering curls grew damp and pinched again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are Eileen&#8217;s daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But his face
went dead white and he got no further.</p>
<p>People were approaching from behind them, too;
voices grew distinct in conversation; somebody turned
up another lamp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do sing that little song again&mdash;the one you sang
for Mr. Skeel,&#8221; said Lee Barres, coming up to the
piano on her brother&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Mrs. Gerhardt has been
waiting very patiently for an opportunity to ask you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXIV
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />A SILENT HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The guests from Hohenlinden had departed from
Foreland Farms; the family had retired. Outside,
under a sparkling galaxy of summer stars,
tall trees stood unstirring; indoors nothing stirred except
the family cat, darkly prowling on velvet-shod
feet in eternal search of those viewless things which are
manifest only to the feline race&mdash;sorcerers all, whether
quadruped or human.</p>
<p>In various bedrooms upstairs lights went out, one
after another, until only two windows remained illuminated,
one in the west wing, one in the north.</p>
<p>For Dulcie, in her negligée and night robe, still sat
by the open window, chin resting on palm, her haunted
gaze remotely lost somewhere beyond the July stars.</p>
<p>And, in his room, Garry had arrived only as far as
removing coat and waistcoat in the process of disrobing
for the night. For his mind was still deeply preoccupied
with Dulcie Soane and with the strange expression
of her face at the piano&mdash;and with the profoundly
altered visage of Murtagh Skeel.</p>
<p>And he was asking himself what could have happened
between those two in such a few minutes there
at the piano in the music-room. For it was evident
to him that Skeel was labouring under poorly controlled
emotion, was dazed by it, and was recovering
self-possession only by a mighty effort.</p>
<p>And when Skeel had finally taken his leave and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
gone away with the Gerhardts, he suddenly stopped on
the porch, returned to the music-room, and, bending
down, had kissed Dulcie&#8217;s hand with a grace and reverence
which made the salute more of a serious ceremony
than the impulsive homage of a romantic poet&#8217;s whim.</p>
<p>Considered by itself, the abrupt return and quaintly
perfect salute might have been taken as a spontaneous
effervescence of that delightful Celtic gallantry so
easily stirred to ebullition by youth and beauty. And
for that it was accepted by the others after Murtagh
Skeel was gone; and everybody ventured to chaff Dulcie
a little about her conquest&mdash;merely the gentle humour
of gentlefolk&mdash;a harmless word or two, a smile
in sympathy.</p>
<p>Garry alone saw in the girl&#8217;s smile no genuine response
to the light badinage, and he knew that her
serenity was troubled, her careless composure forced.</p>
<p>Later, he contrived to say good-night to her alone,
and gave her a chance to speak; but she only murmured
her adieux and went slowly away up the stairs
with Thessalie, not looking back.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Now, sitting there in his dressing-gown, briar pipe
alight, he frowned and pondered over the matter in
the light of what he already knew of Dulcie, of the
dead mother who bore her, of the grotesquely impossible
Soane, of this man, Murtagh Skeel.</p>
<p>What had he and Dulcie found in common to converse
about so earnestly and so long there in the music-room?
What had they talked about to drive the colour
from Dulcie&#8217;s cheeks and alter Skeel&#8217;s countenance
so that he had looked more like his own wraith than his
living self?</p>
<p>That Dulcie&#8217;s mother had known this man, had once,
evidently, been in love with him more or less, doubtless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
was revealed in their conversation at the piano. Had
Skeel enlightened Dulcie any further? And on what
subject? Soane? Her mother? Her origin&mdash;in case
the child had admitted ignorance of it? Was Dulcie,
now, in possession of new facts concerning herself?
Were they agreeable facts? Were they depressing?
Had she learned anything definite in regard to her
birth? Her parentage? Did she know, now, who was
her real father? Was the obvious absurdity of Soane
finally exploded? Had she learned what the drunken
Soane meant by asserting that her name was not Soane
but Fane?</p>
<p>His pipe burned out and he laid it aside, but did not
rise to resume his preparation for bed.</p>
<p>Then, somewhere from the unlighted depths of the
house came the sound of the telephone bell&mdash;at that
hour of night always a slightly ominous sound.</p>
<p>He got up and went down stairs, not troubling to
switch on any light, for the lustre of the starry night
outside silvered every window and made it possible for
him to see his way.</p>
<p>At the clamouring telephone, finally, he unhooked
the receiver:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes! Yes! Oh, is that <i>you</i>,
Renoux? Where on earth are you?... At Northbrook?...
Where?... At the Summit House?
Well, why didn&#8217;t you come here to us?... Oh!...
No, it isn&#8217;t very late. We retire early at Foreland....
Oh, yes, I&#8217;m dressed.... Certainly.... Yes,
come over.... Yes!... <i>Yes</i>!... I&#8217;ll wait for
you in the library.... In an hour?... You bet.
No, I&#8217;m not sleepy.... Sure thing!... Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>He hung up the receiver, turned, and made his way
through the dusk toward the library which was opposite
the music-room across the big entrance hall.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>Before he turned on any light he paused to look out
at the splendour of the stars. The night had grown
warmer; there was no haze, now, only an argentine
clarity in which shadowy trees stood mysterious and
motionless and the dim lawn stretched away to the
distant avenue and wall, lost against their looming border
foliage.</p>
<p>Once he thought he heard a slight sound somewhere
in the house behind him, but presently remembered
that the family cat held sway among the mice at such
an hour.</p>
<p>A little later he turned from the window to light a
lamp, and found himself facing a slim, white figure in
the starry dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie!&#8221; he exclaimed under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why on earth are you wandering about at this
hour?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You made me jump, I can tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was awake&mdash;not in bed yet. I heard the telephone.
Then I went out into the west corridor and
saw you going down stairs.... Is it all right for me
to sit here in my night dress with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, considering&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; she said hastily, &#8220;only I didn&#8217;t know
whether outside your studio&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dulcie, you&#8217;re becoming self-conscious! Stop
it, Sweetness. Don&#8217;t spoil things. Here&mdash;tuck yourself
into this big armchair!&mdash;curl up! There you are.
And here I am&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; dropping into another wide, deep
chair. &#8220;Lord! but you&#8217;re a pretty thing, Dulcie, with
your hair down and all glimmering with starlight!
We&#8217;ll try painting you that way some day&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t
know how to go about it offhand, either. Maybe a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
screened arc-lamp in a dark partition, and a peep-hole&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay back in his chair, studying her, and she
watched him in silence for a while. Presently she
sighed, stirred, placed her feet on the floor as though
preparing to rise. And he came out of his impersonal
abstraction:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want to say, Sweetness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another time,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I don&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear child, you came to me needing the intimacy
of our comradeship&mdash;perhaps its sympathy. My
mind was wandering&mdash;you are so lovely in the starlight.
But you ought to know where my heart is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it open&mdash;a little?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock and see, Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I came to ask you&mdash;Mr. Skeel is coming
to-morrow&mdash;to see me&mdash;alone. Could it be contrived&mdash;without
offending?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it could.... Yes, of course.... Only
it will be conspicuous. You see, Mr. Skeel is much
sought after in certain circles&mdash;beginning to be pursued and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, it&#8217;s quite all right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you, please.... He <i>did</i> know my
mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I supposed so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was the man. I want you to know what
he told me.... I always wish you to know everything
that is in my&mdash;mind&mdash;always, for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned forward in her chair, her pretty, bare
feet extended. One silken sleeve of her negligée had
fallen to the shoulder, revealing the perfect symmetry
of her arm. But he put from his mind the ever latent
artistic delight in her, closed his painter&#8217;s eye to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
protean possibilities, and resolutely concentrated his
mental forces upon what she was now saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;He turns out to be the same man my mother wrote
to&mdash;and who wrote to her.... They were in love,
then. He didn&#8217;t say why he went away, except that
my mother&#8217;s family disliked him.... She lived at a
house called Fane Court.... He spoke of my mother&#8217;s
father as Sir Barry Fane....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t surprise me, Sweetness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did <i>you</i> know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing definite.&#8221; He looked at the lovely, slender-limbed
girl there in the starry dusk. &#8220;I knew
nothing definite,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;but there was no mistaking
the metal from which you had been made&mdash;or
the mould, either. And as for Soane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
smiled.</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If my name is really Fane, there can be only one
conclusion; some kinsman of that name must have
married my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; very gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who was he? My mother never mentioned
him in her letters. What became of him? He must
have been my father. Is he living?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ask Mr. Skeel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He seemed too deeply affected to answer me.
He must have loved my mother very dearly to show
such emotion before me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you ask him, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After we left the piano?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked him that. I had only a few more moments
alone with him before he left. I asked him about my
mother&mdash;to tell me how she looked&mdash;so I could think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
of her more clearly. He has a picture of her on ivory.
He is to bring it to me and tell me more about her.
That is why I must see him to-morrow&mdash;so I may
ask him again about my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear....&#8221; He sat very silent for a while,
then rose, came over, and seated himself on the padded
arm of Dulcie&#8217;s chair, and took both her hands into
his:</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Sweetness. You are what you are to me&mdash;my
dear comrade, my faithful partner sharing our
pretty partnership in art; and, more than these, Dulcie,
you are my friend.... Never doubt that. Never
forget it. Nothing can alter it&mdash;nothing you learn
about your origin can exalt that friendship....
Nothing lessen it. Do you understand? <i>Nothing</i> can
<i>lessen</i> it, save only if you prove untrue to what you
are&mdash;your real self.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had rested her cheek against his arm while he
was speaking. It lay there now, pressed closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for Murtagh Skeel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he is a charming,
cultivated, fascinating man. But if he attempts to
carry out his agitator&#8217;s schemes and his revolutionary
propaganda in this country, he is headed for most
serious trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me why men of his education and character
do such things. They do; that&#8217;s all I know.
Sir Roger Casement is another man not unlike Skeel.
There are many, hot-hearted, generous, brave, irrational.
There is no use blaming them&mdash;no justice in
it, either. The history of British rule in Ireland is
a matter of record.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dulcie, he who strikes at England to-day
strikes at civilisation, at liberty, at God! This is no
time to settle old grievances. And to attempt to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
it by violence, by propaganda&mdash;to attempt a reckoning
of ancient wrongs in any way, to-day, is a crime&mdash;the
crime of treachery against Christ&#8217;s teachings&mdash;of
treason against Lord Christ Himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>After a long interval:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to this war quite soon. Mr. Westmore
said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going&mdash;with my country or without it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I finally lose patience and self-respect....
I don&#8217;t know exactly when, but it will be pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could I go with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pressed her cheek against his arm in silence.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;That has troubled me a lot, Dulcie. Of course
you could stay here; I can arrange&mdash;I had come to a
conclusion in regard to financial matters&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here&mdash;take anything from you&mdash;accept without
service in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care&mdash;if you&mdash;leave me here alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dulcie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. You said it this evening. There will come
a time when you would not find it convenient to have
me&mdash;around&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear, it&#8217;s only because a man and a woman in this
world cannot continue anything of enduring intimacy
without business as an excuse. And even then, the
pleasant informality existing now could not be continued
with anything except very serious disadvantage
to you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You will grow tired of painting me,&#8221; she said under
her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But your life is all before you, Dulcie. Girls
usually marry sooner or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Men do too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I meant&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will marry,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>Again, at her words, the same odd uneasiness began
to possess him as though something obscure, unformulated
as yet, must some day be cleared up by him and
decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave me&mdash;yet,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t take you with me to France.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me enlist for service. Could you be patient
for a few months so that I might learn something&mdash;anything!&mdash;I
don&#8217;t care what, if only I can go with
you? Don&#8217;t they require women to scrub and do unpleasant
things&mdash;humble, unclean, necessary things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t&mdash;with your slender youth and delicate
beauty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;you don&#8217;t know what I could
do to be near you! That is all I want&mdash;all I want in
the world!&mdash;just to be somewhere not too far away. I
couldn&#8217;t stand it, now, if you left me.... I couldn&#8217;t
live&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, suddenly, it was a hot-faced, passionate, sobbing
child who was clinging desperately to his arm and
staunching her tears against it&mdash;saying nothing more,
merely clinging close with quivering lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said impulsively. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you time.
If there&#8217;s anything you can learn that will admit you
to France, come back to town with me and learn it....
Because I don&#8217;t want to leave you, either....
There ought to be some way&mdash;some way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
checked himself abruptly, stared at the bowed head
under its torrent of splendid hair&mdash;at the desperate
white little hands holding so fast to his sleeve, at the
slender body gathered there in the deep chair, and all
aquiver now.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go&mdash;together,&#8221; he said unsteadily....
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can; I promise.... You must go upstairs
to bed, now.... Dulcie!... dear girl....&#8221;</p>
<p>She released his arm, tried to get up from her chair
obediently, blinded by tears and groping in the starlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me guide you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His voice was strained, his
touch feverish and unsteady, and the convulsive closing
of her fingers over his seemed to burn to his very
bones.</p>
<p>At the stairs she tried to speak, thanking him, asking
pardon for her tears, her loss of self-command,
penitent, afraid that she had lowered herself, strained
his friendship&mdash;troubled him&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&mdash;<i>want</i> you,&#8221; he said in an odd, indistinct,
hesitating voice.... &#8220;Things must be cleared up&mdash;matters
concerning us&mdash;affairs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes a moment and rested both hands
on the banisters as though fatigued, then she looked
down at him where he stood watching her:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had rather go without me&mdash;if it is better
for you&mdash;less troublesome&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you,&#8221; he said in a dull voice, &#8220;I want
you. You must fit yourself to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so kind to me&mdash;so wonderful&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He merely stared at her; she turned almost wearily
to resume her ascent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had reached the landing above. She bent over,
looking down at him in the dusk.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Did you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;yes, I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I <i>want</i> you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true. I want you always. I&#8217;m just beginning
to understand that myself. Please don&#8217;t ever forget
what I say to you now, Dulcie; I want you. I shall always
want you. Always! As long as I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned heavily on the newel-post above, looking
down.</p>
<p>He could not see that her eyes were closed, that her
lips moved in voiceless answer. She was only a vague
white shape there in the dusk above him&mdash;a mystery
which seemed to have been suddenly born out of some
poignant confusion of his own mind.</p>
<p>He saw her turn, fade into the darkness. And he
stood there, not moving, aware of the chaos within him,
of shapeless questions being evolved out of this profound
disturbance&mdash;of an inner consciousness groping
with these questions&mdash;questions involving other questions
and menacing him with the necessity of decision.</p>
<p>After a while, too, he became conscious of his own
voice sounding there in the darkness:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very near to love.... I have been close to it....
It would be very easy to fall in love to-night....
But I am wondering&mdash;about to-morrow....
And afterward.... But I have been very near&mdash;very
near to love, to-night....&#8221;</p>
<p>The front doorbell rang through the darkness.</p>

</div>
<p>When Barres opened the front door he saw
Renoux standing there in the shadow of the
porch, silhouetted against the starlight. They
exchanged a silent grip; Renoux stepped inside; Barres
closed the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I light up?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. There are complications. I&#8217;ve been followed,
I think. Take me somewhere near a window which commands
the driveway out there. I&#8217;d like to keep my eye
on it while we are talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Barres, under his breath. He
guided Renoux through the shadowy entrance hall to
the library, moved two padded armchairs to the window
facing the main drive, motioned Renoux to seat
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you arrive?&#8221; he asked in a cautious voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You got here before we did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I followed Souchez and Alost. Do you know
who <i>they</i> were following?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of your guests at dinner this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skeel!&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux nodded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You saw them start for the train. Skeel was
on the train. But the conference at your studio delayed
me. So I came up by automobile last night.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been here all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux nodded, but his keen eyes were fixed on the
drive, shining silver-grey in the starlight. And his
gaze continually reverted to it while he continued speaking:</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend, things are happening. Let me first tell
you what is the situation. Over this entire hemisphere
German spies are busy, German intrigue and propaganda
are being accelerated, treason is spreading from
a thousand foci of infection.</p>
<p>&#8220;In South America matters are very serious. A
revolution is being planned by the half million Germans
in Brazil; the neutrality of Argentine is being
most grossly violated and Count Luxburg, the boche
Ambassador, is already tampering with Chile and other
Southern Republics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, the Mexican trouble is due to German
intrigue which is trying desperately to involve that Republic
and yours and also drag in Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Honolulu the German cruiser which your Government
has interned is sending out wireless information
while her band plays to drown the crackle of the
instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;And from the Golden Gate to the Delaware capes,
and from the Soo to the Gulf, the spies of Germany
swarm in your great Republic, planning your destruction
in anticipation of the war which will surely come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres reddened in the darkness and his heart beat
more rapidly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it really will come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;War with Germany? My friend, I am certain of
it. Your Government may not be certain. It is, if
you permit a foreigner to say so&mdash;an&mdash;unusual Administration....
In this way, for example: it is
cognisant of almost everything treasonable that is happening;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
it maintains agents in close contact with every
mischief-hatching German diplomat in this hemisphere;
it even has agents in the German Embassies&mdash;agents
unsuspected, who daily rub elbows with German Ambassadors
themselves!</p>
<p>&#8220;It knows what Luxburg is doing; it is informed
every day concerning Bernstorff&#8217;s dirty activities; the
details of the Mexican and Japanese affairs are familiar
to Mr. Lansing; all that happens aboard the
<i>Geier</i>, the interned German liners&mdash;all that occurs in
German consulates, commercial offices, business houses,
clubs, cafés, saloons, is no secret to your Government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, nothing has been done, nothing is being done
except to continue to collect data of the most monstrous
and stupendous conspiracy that ever threatened a free
nation! I repeat that nothing is being done; no preparation
is being made to face the hurricane which has
been looming for two years and more, growing ever
blacker over your horizon. All the world can see the
lightning playing behind those storm clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, my God!&mdash;not an umbrella! Not an order for
overshoes and raincoats!... I am not, perhaps, in
error when I suggest that the Administration is an&mdash;unusual
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Renoux said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry. The reckoning will be heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you know. Your great politician, Mr. Roosevelt,
knows; your great Admiral, Mahan, knew; your
great General, Wood, knows. Also, perhaps some million
or more sane, clear thinking American citizens
know.&#8221; He made a hopeless gesture. &#8220;It is a pity,
Barres, my friend.... Well&mdash;it is, of course, the affair
of your people to decide.... We French can only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
wait.... But we have never doubted your ultimate
decision.... Lafayette did not live in vain. Yorktown
was not merely a battle. Your Washington
lighted a torch for your people and for ours to hold
aloft eternally. Even the rain of blood drenching our
Revolution could not extinguish it. It still burned at
Gravelotte, at Metz, at Sedan. It burned above the
smoke and dust of the Commune. It burned at the
Marne. It still burns, mon ami.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alors&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He sat silent for a few moments, his
gaze intent on the starry obscurity outdoors. Then,
slow and pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The particular mess, the cooking of which interests
my Government, the English Government, and
yours, is now on the point of boiling over. It&#8217;s this
Irish stew I speak of. Poor devils&mdash;they must be
crazy, every one of them, to do what they are already
beginning to do.... You remember the papers which
you secured?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what we did last night at Grogan&#8217;s has prematurely
dumped the fat into the fire. They know
they&#8217;ve been robbed; they know that their plans are
in our hands. Do you suppose that stops them? No!
On the contrary, they are at this very moment attempting,
as you say in New York, to beat us to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way: the signal for an Irish attempt on Canada
is to be the destruction of the Welland Canal.
You remember the German suggestion that an ore
steamer be seized? They&#8217;re going to try it. And if
that fails, they&#8217;re to take their power boat into the
canal anyway and blow up a lock, even if they blow
up themselves with it. Did you ever hear of such madness?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
Mon dieu, if only we had those men under your
flag on our western front!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who these men are?&#8221; asked Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your dinner guest&mdash;Murtagh Skeel&mdash;leads this
company of Death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now! To-morrow! That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here! That&#8217;s
why your Secret Service men are arriving. I tell you
the mess is on the point of boiling over. The crew is
already on its way to take over the launch. They&#8217;re
travelling west singly, by separate trains and routes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who they are&mdash;these madmen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is the list&mdash;don&#8217;t strike a light! I can recall
their names, I think&mdash;some of them anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are any of them Germans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not one. Your German doesn&#8217;t blow himself up
with anything but beer. Not he! No; he lights a fuse
and legs it! I don&#8217;t say he&#8217;s a coward. But self-immolation
for abstract principle isn&#8217;t in him. There
have been instances resembling it at sea&mdash;probably not
genuine&mdash;not like that poor sergeant of ours in 1870,
who went into the citadel at Laon and shoved a torch
into the bin of loose powder under the magazine....
Because the city had surrendered. And Paris was not
many miles away.... So he blew himself up with
citadel, magazine, all the Prussians in the neighbourhood,
and most of the town.... Well&mdash;these Irish
are planning something of that sort on the Welland
Canal.... Murtagh Skeel leads them. The others I
remember are Madigan, Cassidy, Dolan, McBride&mdash;and
that fellow Soane!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is <i>he</i> one of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He surely is. He went west on the same train that
brought Skeel here. And now I&#8217;ll tell you what has
been done and why I&#8217;m here.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t located the power-boat on the lake.
But the Canadians are watching for it and your agents
are following these Irishmen. When the crew assembles
they are to be arrested and their power-boat and explosives
seized.</p>
<p>&#8220;I and my men have no official standing here, of
course&mdash;would not be tolerated in any co-operation,
<i>officially</i>. But we have a certain understanding with
certain authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see? Very well. Then, with delicacy and discretion,
we keep in touch with Mr. Skeel.... And
with other people.... You see?... He is abed in
the large house of Mr. Gerhardt over yonder at Northbrook....
Under surveillance.... He moves? We
move&mdash;very discreetly. You see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then. But I am obliged to tell you, also,
that the hunting is not done entirely by our side. No!
In turn, I and my men, and also your agents, are being
hunted by German agents.... It is that which
annoys and hampers us, because these German agents
continually dog us and give the alarm to these Irishmen.
You see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are the German agents? Do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well indeed. Bernstorff is the head; Von
Papen and Boy-ed come next. Under them serve certain
so-called &#8216;Diplomatic Agents of Class No. 1&#8217;&mdash;Adolf
Gerhardt is one of them; his partners, Otto
Klein and Joseph Schwartzmeyer are two others.</p>
<p>&#8220;They, in turn, have under them diplomatic agents
of the second class&mdash;men such as Ferez Bey, Franz
Lehr, called <i>K17</i>. You see? Then, lower still in the
scale, come the spies who actually investigate under
orders; men like Dave Sendelbeck, Johnny Klein, Louis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
Hochstein, Max Freund. And, then, lowest of all in
rank are the rank and file&mdash;the secret &#8216;shock-troops&#8217;
who carry out desperate enterprises under some leader.
Among the Germans these are the men who sneak about
setting fires, lighting the fuses of bombs, scuttling ships,
defacing Government placards, poisoning Red Cross
bandages to be sent to the Allies&mdash;that sort. But
among them are no battalions of Death. <i>Non pas!</i>
And, for that, you see, they use these Irish. You understand
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then! I trust you absolutely, Barres. And
so I came over to ask you&mdash;and your clever friends,
Mademoiselle Dunois, Miss Soane, Mr. Westmore, to
keep their eyes on this man Skeel to-morrow afternoon
and also to-morrow evening. Because they will be
guests at the Gerhardts&#8217;. Is it not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your Government&#8217;s agents will be there. They
will also be in the neighbourhood, watching roads and
railway stations. I have one man in service with the
Gerhardts&mdash;their head chauffeur. If anything happens&mdash;if
Skeel tries to slip away&mdash;if you miss him&mdash;I
would be very grateful if you and your friends notify
the head chauffeur, Menard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I want. Just get word to Menard that
Skeel seems to be missing. That will be sufficient. Will
you say this to your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, Renoux. I&#8217;ll be glad to. I&#8217;ll be particularly
happy to offer to Miss Dunois this proof of
your confidence in her integrity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux looked very grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Miss Dunois is what she pretends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
to be. I have so informed my Government at
home and its representatives at Washington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a telegram in cipher from Washington late
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Favourable to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Our Ambassador is taking up immediately the
clues Miss Dunois furnished me last night. Also, he
has cabled at length to my home Government. At this
hour, no doubt, d&#8217;Eblis, Bolo, probably an ex-minister
or two, are being watched. And in this country your
Government is now in possession of facts which must
suggest a very close surveillance of the activities of
Ferez Bey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux shook his head:</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>was</i> in New York. But he gave us the slip. An
eel!&#8221; he added, rising. &#8220;Oh, we shall pick up his slimy
traces again in time. But it is mortifying.... Well,
thank you, mon ami. I must go.&#8221; And he started toward
the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a car anywhere?&#8221; asked Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, up the road a bit.&#8221; He glanced through the
sidelight of the front door, carelessly. &#8220;A couple of
men out yonder dodging about. Have you noticed
them, Barres?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re out there in the shadow of your wall. I
imagined that I&#8217;d be followed.&#8221; He smiled and opened
the front door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; whispered Barres. &#8220;You are not going out
there alone, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. There&#8217;s no danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t like it, Renoux. I&#8217;ll walk as far as
your car&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble! I have no personal apprehension&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; muttered the other, continuing on
down the front steps beside his comrade.</p>
<p>Renoux shrugged good-humouredly his disapproval
of such precaution, but made no further protest. Nobody
was visible anywhere on the grounds. The big
iron gates were still locked, but the wicket was open.
Through this they stepped out onto the macadam.</p>
<p>A little farther along stood a touring car with two
men in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221; began Renoux&mdash;when his words were cut
by the crack of a pistol, and the red tail-light of
the car crashed into splinters and went dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, by God!&#8221; remarked Renoux calmly, looking
at the woods across the road and leisurely producing
an automatic pistol.</p>
<p>Then, from deeper in the thicket, two bright flames
stabbed the darkness and the crash of the shots re-echoed
among the trees.</p>
<p>Both men in the touring car instantly turned loose
their pistols; Renoux said, in a voice at once perplexed
and amused:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go home, Barres. I don&#8217;t want people to know you
are out here.... I&#8217;ll see you again soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. Please&mdash;you would oblige me by keeping
clear of this if you really desire to help me.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were no more shots. Renoux stepped leisurely
into the tonneau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what the devil do you gentlemen make of
this?&#8221; Barres heard him say in his cool, humorous
voice. &#8220;It really looks as though the boches were getting
nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car started. Barres could see Renoux and another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
man sitting with pistols levelled as the car glided
along the fringe of woods. But there were no more
shots on either side, and, after the car had disappeared,
Barres turned and retraced his way.</p>
<p>Then, as he entered his own gate by the side wicket,
and turned to lock it with his own key, an electric
torch flashed in his face, blinding him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him have it!&#8221; muttered somebody behind the
dazzling light.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not one of them!&#8221; said another voice distinctly.
&#8220;Look out what you&#8217;re doing! Douse your
glim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the fierce glare faded to a cinder. Barres
heard running feet on the macadam, the crash of shrubbery
opposite. But he could see nobody; and presently
the footsteps in the woods were no longer audible.</p>
<p>There seemed to be nothing for him to do in the matter.
He lingered by the wicket for a while, peering
into the night, listening. He saw nothing; heard nothing
more that night.</p>

<p>Barres senior rose with the sun. Also with
determination, which took the form of a note
slipped under his wife&#8217;s door as he was leaving
the house:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Darling</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost last night&#8217;s fishing and I&#8217;m hanged if I lose it
to-night! So don&#8217;t ask me to fritter away a perfectly
good evening at the Gerhardt&#8217;s party, because the sun is
up; I&#8217;m off to the woods; and I shall remain there until
the last trout breaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the little Soane girl that I left a rod for her in
the work-room, if she cares to join me at the second lake.
Garry can bring her over and leave her if he doesn&#8217;t
wish to fish. Don&#8217;t send a man over with a lot of food
and shawls. I&#8217;ve a creel full of provisions, and I am sufficiently
clad, and I hate to be disturbed and I am never
grateful to people who try to be good to me. However, I
love you very dearly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At half past seven trays were sent to Mrs. Barres
and to Lee; and at eight-thirty they were in the saddle
and their horses fetlock deep in morning dew.</p>
<p>Dulcie, sipping her chocolate in bed, marked their
departure with sleepy eyes. For the emotions of the
night before had told on her, and when a maid came to
remove the tray she settled down among her pillows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
again, blinking unresponsively at the invitation of the
sun, which cast over her a fairy net of gold.</p>
<p>Thessalie, in negligée, came in later and sat down on
the edge of her bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You sleepy little thing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the men have
breakfasted and are waiting for us on the tennis court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to play,&#8221; said Dulcie. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know how to do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You soon will, if you get up, you sweet little lazy-bones!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;ll ever learn to play tennis and golf
and to ride?&#8221; inquired Dulcie. &#8220;You know how to do
everything so well, Thessa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear child, it&#8217;s all locked up in you&mdash;the ability to
do everything&mdash;be anything! The only difference between
us is that I had the chance to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t even stand on my head,&#8221; said Dulcie
wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever try?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy. Do you want to see me do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please, Thessa!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Thessalie, calmly smiling, rose, cast herself lightly
upon her hands, straightened her lithe figure leisurely,
until, amid a cataract of tumbling silk and chiffon,
her rose silk slippers pointed toward the ceiling. Then,
always with graceful deliberation, she brought her feet
to the floor, forming an arc with her body; held it a
moment, and slowly rose upright, her flushed face half-buried
in her loosened hair.</p>
<p>Dulcie, in raptures, climbed out of bed and insisted
on immediate instruction. Down on the tennis court,
Garry and Westmore heard their peals of laughter
and came across the lawn under the window to remonstrate.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you ever going to get dressed!&#8221; called up
Westmore. &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to play doubles with
us you&#8217;d better get busy, because it&#8217;s going to be a
hot day!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Thessalie went away to dress and Dulcie tiptoed
into her bath, which the maid had already drawn.</p>
<p>But it was an hour before they appeared on the
lawn, cool and fresh in their white skirts and shoes, and
found Westmore and Barres, red and drenched, hammering
each other across the net in their second furious
set.</p>
<p>So Dulcie took her first lesson under Garry&#8217;s auspices;
and she took to it naturally, her instinct being
sound, but her technique as charmingly awkward as a
young bird&#8217;s in its first essay at flying.</p>
<p>To see her all in white, with sleeves tucked up,
throat bare, and the sun brilliant on her ruddy, rippling
hair, produced a curious impression on Barres.
As far as the East is from the West, so far was this
Dulcie of the tennis court separated from the wistful,
shabby child behind the desk at Dragon Court.</p>
<p>Could they possibly be the same&mdash;this lithe, fresh,
laughing girl, with white feet flashing and snowy skirts
awhirl?&mdash;and the pale, grey-eyed slip of a thing that
had come one day to his threshold with a faltering request
for admittance to that wonderland wherein dwelt
only such as he?</p>
<p>Now, those grey eyes had turned violet, tinged with
the beauty of the open sky; the loosened hair had become
a net entangling the very sunlight; and the frail
body, now but one smooth, soft symmetry, seemed
fairly lustrous with the shining soul it masked within it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>She came over to the net, breathless, laughing, to
shake hands with her victorious opponents.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Garry,&#8221; she said, turning penitently
to him, &#8220;but I need such a lot of help in the world before
I&#8217;m worth anything to anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right as you are. You always have been
all right,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;You never were
worth less than you are worth now; you&#8217;ll never be
worth more than you are worth to me at this moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were walking slowly across the lawn toward the
northern veranda. She halted a moment on the grass
and cast a questioning glance at him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it please you to have me learn things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always please me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad.... I try.... But don&#8217;t you think
you&#8217;d like me better if I were not so ignorant?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her absently, shook his head:</p>
<p>&#8220;No ... I couldn&#8217;t like you better.... I couldn&#8217;t
care more&mdash;for any girl&mdash;than I care for you....
Did you suspect that, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved slowly forward across the grass&mdash;he
distrait, his handsome head lowered, swinging his tennis-bat
as he walked; she very still and lithe and slender,
moving beside him with lowered eyes fixed on their
mingled shadows on the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;When are you to see Mr. Skeel?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon.... He asked if he might hope to
find me alone.... I didn&#8217;t know exactly what to say.
So I told him about the rose arbour.... He said he
would pay his respects to your mother and sister and
then ask their permission to see me there alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>They came to the veranda; Dulcie seated herself
on the steps and he remained standing on the grass in
front of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;that I can never care
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
less for you than I do at this moment.... Don&#8217;t forget
what I say, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, happy, wondering, even perhaps
a little apprehensive in her uncertainty as to his
meaning.</p>
<p>He did not seem to care to enlighten her further. His
mood changed, too, even as she looked at him, and she
saw the troubled gravity fade and the old gaiety glimmering
in his eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a mind to put you on a horse, Sweetness, and
see what happens,&#8221; he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry! I don&#8217;t want to tumble off before <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before whom had you rather land on that red head
of yours?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I&#8217;d be more sympathetic
than many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have Thessa watch me break my neck.
Do you mind? It&#8217;s horrid to be so sensitive, I suppose.
But, Garry, I couldn&#8217;t bear to have you see me
so shamefully awkward and demoralised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fancy your being awkward! Well, all right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked across the lawn, where Thessalie and Westmore
sat together, just outside the tennis court, under
a brilliant lawn umbrella.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the spectacle caused him no subtle
pang, although their heads were pretty close together
and their mutual absorption in whatever they were
saying appeared evident enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em chatter,&#8221; he said after an instant&#8217;s hesitation.
&#8220;Thessa or my sister can ride with you this afternoon
when it&#8217;s cooler. I suppose you&#8217;ll take to the
saddle as though born there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing. All Irish girls&mdash;of your quality&mdash;take
to it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;quality?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours.... It&#8217;s merely happened so,&#8221; he added irrelevantly,
&#8220;&mdash;but the contrary couldn&#8217;t have mattered
... as long as you are <i>you</i>! Nothing else matters one
way or another. You <i>are</i> you: that answers all questions,
fulfils all requirements&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>don&#8217;t</i> quite understand what you say, Garry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you, Sweetness? Don&#8217;t you understand why
you&#8217;ve always been exactly what you appear like at
this moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with her lovely, uncertain smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been myself, I suppose. You are teasing
me dreadfully!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed in a nervous, excited way, not like himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet you have always been yourself, Sweetness!&mdash;in
spite of everything you&#8217;ve always been <i>yourself</i>.
I am very slow in discovering it. But I think I realise
it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please,&#8221; she remonstrated, &#8220;you are laughing at me
and I don&#8217;t know why. I think you&#8217;ve been talking
nonsense and expecting me to pretend to understand....
If you don&#8217;t stop laughing at me I shall retire
to my room <ins title='Added missing quote'>and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</ins></p>
<p>&#8220;What, Sweetness?&#8221; he demanded, still laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Change to a cooler gown,&#8221; she said, humorously
vexed at her own inability to threaten or punish him
for his gaiety at her expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll change too, and we&#8217;ll meet in the
music-room!&#8221;</p>
<p>She considered him askance:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be more respectful to me, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Respectful? I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then, I&#8217;m not coming back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></div>
<p>But when he entered the music-room half an hour
later, Dulcie was seated demurely before the piano,
and when he came and stood behind her she dropped her
head straight back and looked up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a wonderful icy bath,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m
ready for anything. Are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost,&#8221; he said, looking down at her.</p>
<p>She straightened up, gazed silently at the piano for
a few moments; sounded a few chords. Then her
fingers wandered uncertainly, as though groping for
something that eluded them&mdash;something that they delicately
sought to interpret. But apparently she did
not discover it; and her search among the keys ended
in a soft chord like a sigh. Only her lips could have
spoken more plainly.</p>
<p>At that moment Westmore and Thessalie came in
breezily and remained to gossip a few minutes before
bathing and changing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play something jolly!&#8221; said Westmore. &#8220;One of
those gay Irish things, you know, like &#8216;The Honourable
Michael Dunn,&#8217; or &#8216;Finnigan&#8217;s Wake,&#8217; or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any,&#8221; said Dulcie, smiling. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a song called &#8216;Asthore.&#8217; My mother wrote it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you sing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl ran her fingers over the keys musingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember it presently. I know one or two
old songs like &#8216;Irishmen All.&#8217; Do you know that song?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she sang it in her gay, unembarrassed way:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;Warm is our love for the island that bore us,</p>
<p>Ready are we as our fathers before us,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Genial and gallant men,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Fearless and valiant men,</p>
<p>Faithful to Erin we answer her call.</p>
<p class='indent2'>Ulster men, Munster men,</p>
<p class='indent2'>Connaught men, Leinster men,</p>
<p>Irishmen all we answer her call!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried Westmore. &#8220;Try it again, Dulcie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll like this better,&#8221; she said:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;Our Irish girls are beautiful,</p>
<p>As all the world will own;</p>
<p class='indent2'>An Irish smile in Irish eyes</p>
<p>Would melt a heart of stone;</p>
<p class='indent2'>But all their smiles and all their wiles</p>
<p>Will quickly turn to sneers</p>
<p class='indent2'>If you fail to fight for Erin</p>
<p>In the Irish Volunteers!&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Westmore, beating time and picking
up the chorus of the &#8220;Irish Volunteers,&#8221; which Dulcie
played to a thunderous finish amid frantic applause.</p>
<p>She sang for them &#8220;The West&#8217;s Awake!&#8221;, &#8220;The
Risin&#8217; of the Moon,&#8221; &#8220;Clare&#8217;s Dragoons,&#8221; and &#8220;Paddy
Get Up!&#8221; And after Westmore had exercised his
lungs sufficiently in every chorus, he and Thessalie went
off to their respective quarters, leaving Barres leaning
on the piano beside Dulcie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your people are a splendid lot&mdash;given half a
chance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. After all, Sweetness, you&#8217;re Irish, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I am,&#8221; she murmured half to
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever you are it&#8217;s the same to me, Dulcie.&#8221;
... He took a few short, nervous turns across the
room; walked slowly back to her: &#8220;Has it come back
to you yet&mdash;that song of your mother&#8217;s you were trying
to remember?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></div>
<p>Even while he was speaking the song came back to
her memory&mdash;her mother&#8217;s song called &#8220;Asthore&#8221;&mdash;startling
her with its poignant significance to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you recollect it?&#8221; he asked again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes ... I can&#8217;t sing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to sing &#8216;Asthore&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She bent her
head and gazed at the keyboard, the painful colour
dyeing her neck and cheeks.</p>
<p>When at length she looked up at him out of lovely,
distressed eyes, something in his face&mdash;something&mdash;some
new expression which she dared not interpret&mdash;set
her heart flying. And, scarcely knowing what she
was saying in her swift and exquisite confusion:</p>
<p>&#8220;The words of my mother&#8217;s song would mean
nothing to you, Garry,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;You could not
understand them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B-because you could not be in sympathy with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know? Try!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>The smile edging her lips glimmered in her eyes now&mdash;a
reckless little glint of humour, almost defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you insist that I sing &#8216;Asthore&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed conscious of a latent excitement in her to
which something within himself was already responsive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about a lover,&#8221; she said, &#8220;&mdash;one of the old-fashioned,
head-long, hot-headed sort&mdash;Irish, of course!&mdash;you&#8217;d
not understand&mdash;such things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her
tongue and colour were running random riot; her
words outstripped her thoughts and tripped up her
tongue, scaring her a little. She drummed on the keys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
a rollicking trill or two, hesitated, stole a swift, uncertain
glance at him.</p>
<p>A delicate intoxication enveloped her, stimulating,
frightening her a little, yet hurrying her into speech
again:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sing it for you, Garry asthore! And if I were
a lad I&#8217;d be singing my own gay credo!&mdash;if I were the
lad&mdash;and you but a lass, asthore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, though her gray eyes winced and her flying
colour betrayed her trepidation, she looked straight at
him, laughingly, and her clear, childish voice continued
the little prelude to &#8220;Asthore&#8221;:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<p>The refrain, pronounced <i>Bay-nayring-ee</i>, is common to a number
of Irish love-songs written during the last century. It should
be translated: &#8220;Whoever she be.&#8221;</p>
<p>In writing this song, it is evident that Eileen Fane was inspired
by Blind William of Tipperary; and that she was beholden
to Carroll O&#8217;Daly for her &#8220;Eileen, my Treasure,&#8221; although not
to Robin Adair of County Wicklow.</p>
<p class='sig1'><span class='smcap'>Author.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Dulcie&#8217;s voice and her flushed smile, too, faded, died
out. She looked down at the keyboard, where her
white hands rested idly; she bent lower&mdash;a little lower;
laid her arms on the music-rest, her face on her crossed
arms. And, slowly, the tears fell without a tremor,
without a sound.</p>
<p>He had leaned over her shoulders; his bowed head was
close to hers&mdash;so close that he became aware of the
hot, tearful fragrance of her breath; but there was
not a sound from her, not a stir.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Sweetness?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t know.... I didn&#8217;t m-mean to&mdash;cry....
And I don&#8217;t know why I should.... I&#8217;m very
h-happy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She withdrew one arm and stretched it
out, blindly, seeking him; and he took her hand and
held it close to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so distressed, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m happy.... You know I am....
My heart was very full; that is all.... I don&#8217;t seem
to know how to express myself sometimes.... Perhaps
it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t quite dare.... So something
gives way.... And this happens&mdash;tears. Don&#8217;t mind
them, please.... If I could reach my handkerchief&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She drew the tiny square of sheer stuff
from her bosom and rested her closed eyes on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s silly, isn&#8217;t it, Garry?... W-when a girl is
so heavenly contented.... Is anybody coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Westmore and Thessa!&#8221;</p>
<p>She whisked her tears away and sat up swiftly. But
Thessa merely called to them that she and Westmore
were off for a walk, and passed on through the hall
and out through the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garry,&#8221; she murmured, looking away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I go to my room and fix my hair? Because
Mr. Skeel will be here. Do you mind if I leave you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not, you charming child!&#8221; Then, as he
looked down at her hand, which he still retained, his
expression altered; he inclosed the slender fingers, bent
slowly and touched the fragrant palm with his lips.</p>
<p>They were both on their feet the next second; she
passing him with a pale, breathless little smile, and
swiftly crossing the hall; he dumb, confused by the sudden
tumult within him, standing there with one hand
holding to the piano as though for support, and looking
after the slim, receding figure till it disappeared beyond
the library door.</p>
<p>His mother and sister returned from their morning
ride, lingered to chat with him, then went away to dress
for luncheon. Murtagh Skeel had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Westmore and Thessalie returned from their walk in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
the woods by the second lake, reporting a distant view
of Barres senior, fishing madly from a canoe.</p>
<p>Dulcie came down and joined them in the library.
Later Mrs. Barres and Lee appeared, and luncheon was
announced.</p>
<p>Murtagh Skeel had not come to Foreland Farms, and
there was no word from him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barres spoke of his absence during luncheon,
for Garry had told her he was coming to talk to Dulcie
about her mother, whom he had known very well in
Ireland.</p>
<p>Luncheon ended, and the cool north veranda became
the popular rendezvous for the afternoon, and later
for tea. People from Northbrook drove, rode, or
motored up for a cheering cup, and a word or two of
gossip. But Skeel did not come.</p>
<p>By half-past five the north veranda was thronged
with a gaily chattering and very numerous throng from
neighbouring estates. The lively gossip was of war,
of the coming elections, of German activities, of the
Gerhardts&#8217; promised moonlight spectacle and dance, of
Murtagh Skeel and the romantic interest he had
aroused among Northbrook folk.</p>
<p>So many people were arriving or leaving and such a
delightful and general informality reigned that Dulcie,
momentarily disengaged from a vapid but persistent
dialogue with a chuckle-headed but persistent youth,
ventured to slip into the house, and through it to the
garden in the faint hope that perhaps Murtagh Skeel
might have avoided the tea-crush and had gone directly
there.</p>
<p>But the rose arbour was empty; only the bubble of
the little wall fountain and a robin&#8217;s evening melody
broke the scented stillness of the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Her mind was full of Murtagh Skeel, her heart of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
Garry Barres, as she stood there in that blossoming
solitude, listening to the robin and the fountain, while
her eyes wandered across flower-bed, pool, and clipped
greensward, and beyond the garden wall to the hill
where three pines stood silver-green against the sky.</p>
<p>Little by little the thought of Murtagh Skeel faded
from her mind; fuller and fuller grew her heart with
confused emotions new to her&mdash;emotions too perplexing,
too deep, too powerful, perhaps, for her to understand&mdash;or
to know how to resist or to endure. For
the first vague sweetness of her thoughts had grown
keen to the verge of pain&mdash;an exquisite spiritual tension
which hurt her, bewildered her with the deep emotions
it stirred.</p>
<p>To love, had been a phrase to her; a lover, a name.
For beyond that childish, passionate adoration which
Barres had evoked in her, and which to her meant
friendship, nothing more subtly mature, more vital, had
threatened her unawakened adolescence with any clearer
comprehension of him or any deeper apprehension of
herself.</p>
<p>And even now it was not knowledge that pierced her,
lighting little confusing flashes in her mind and heart.
For her heart was still a child&#8217;s heart; and her mind,
stimulated and rapidly developing under the warm and
magic kindness of this man who had become her only
friend, had not thought of him in any other way....
Until to-day.</p>
<p>What had happened in her mind, in her heart, she
had not analysed&mdash;probably was afraid to, there at the
piano in the music-room. And later, in her bedroom,
when she had summoned up innocent courage sufficient
for self-analysis, she didn&#8217;t know how to question herself&mdash;did
not realise exactly what had happened to her,
and never even thought of including him in the enchanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
cataclysm which had befallen her mind and
heart and soul.</p>
<p>Thessalie and Westmore appeared on the lawn by
the pool. Behind the woods the sky was tinted with
pale orange.</p>
<p>It may have been the psychic quality of the Celt in
Dulcie&mdash;a pale glimmer of clairvoyance&mdash;some momentary
and vague premonition wirelessed through the evening
stillness which set her sensitive body vibrating;
for she turned abruptly and gazed northward across
the woods and hills&mdash;remained motionless, her grey
eyes fixed on the far horizon, all silvery with the hidden
glimmer of unlighted stars.</p>
<p>Then she slowly said aloud to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not come. He will never come again&mdash;this
man who loved my mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres approached across the grass, looking for her.
She went forward through the arbour to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he come?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not coming, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? Have you heard anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head:</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But he isn&#8217;t coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably he&#8217;ll explain this evening at the Gerhardts&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never see him again,&#8221; she said absently.</p>
<p>He turned and gave her a searching look. Her gaze
was remote, her face a little pale.</p>
<p>They walked back to the house together in silence.</p>
<p>A servant met them in the hall with a note on a tray.
It was for Barres; Dulcie passed on with a pale little
smile of dismissal; Barres opened the note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The pot has boiled over, mon ami. Something has
scared Skeel. He gave us the slip very cleverly, leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
Gerhardt&#8217;s house before sunrise and motoring north at
crazy speed. Where he will strike the railway I have no
means of knowing. Your Government&#8217;s people are trying
to cover Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. On the Canada side
the authorities have been notified and are alert I hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gerhardt&#8217;s country house is a nest of mischief hatchers.
One in particular is under surveillance and will be arrested.
His name is Tauscher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, mon ami, it has just been discovered that
there are <i>two</i> plots to blow up the Welland Canal! One is
Skeel&#8217;s. The other is Tauscher&#8217;s. It is a purely German
plot. They don&#8217;t intend to blow themselves up these Huns.
Oh no! They expect to get away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently Bernstorff puts no faith in Skeel&#8217;s mad plan.
So, in case it doesn&#8217;t pan out, here is Tauscher with another
plan, made in Germany, and very, very thorough.
Isn&#8217;t it characteristic? Here is the report I received this
morning:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Captain Franz von Papen, Military Attaché on the
ambassadorial staff of Count von Bernstorff, and Captain
Hans Tauscher, who, besides being the Krupp agent in
America, is also, by appointment of the German War
Office, von Papen&#8217;s chief military assistant in the United
States, have plotted the destruction of the Welland Canal
in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Captain Hans Tauscher will be arrested and indicted
for violation of Section 13 of the United States Criminal
Code, for setting on foot a military enterprise against
Canada during the neutrality of the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tauscher is a German reserve officer and is subject
to the orders of Captain Franz von Papen, Military Attaché
of Count von Bernstorff. His indictment will be
brought about by reason of an attempt to blow up parts
of the Welland Canal, the waterway connecting Lakes
Erie and Ontario. A small party of Germans, under command
of one von der Goltz, have started from New York
for the purpose of committing this act of sabotage, and,
incidentally, of assassination of all men, women and children
who might be involved in the explosion at the point
to be selected by the plotters.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tauscher bought and furnished to this crowd of assassins
the dynamite which was to be used for the purpose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
The fact that Tauscher had bought the dynamite has become
known to the United States authorities and he will
be called upon to make an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Captain Tauscher is said to be an agreeable companion,
but he had the ordinary predilection of a German
officer for assassinating women and children.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, mon ami, this is the report. I expect that
United States Secret Service men will arrest Tauscher to-night.
Perhaps Gerhardt, also, will be arrested.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, at the dance to-night you need not look
for Skeel. But may I suggest that you and Mr. Westmore
keep your eyes on Mademoiselle Dunois. Because,
at the railway station to-day, the German agents, Franz
Lehr and Max Freund, were recognised by my men, disguised
as liveried chauffeurs, but in whose service we
have not yet been able to discover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, it might be well for you and Mr. Westmore
to remain near Mademoiselle Dunois during the evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Au revoir! I shall see you at the dance.</p>
<p class='sig1'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Renoux.</span>&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXVII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />THE MOONLIT WAY</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Barres whistled and sang alternately as he tied
his evening tie before his looking glass.</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent4'>&#8220;<i>And I care not, I,</i></p>
<p><i>Who ever she be</i></p>
<p class='indent2'><i>I could not love her more!</i>&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>he chanted gaily, examining the effect and buttoning
his white waistcoat.</p>
<p>Westmore, loitering near and waiting for him, referred
again, indignantly, to Renoux&#8217;s report concerning
the presence of Freund and Lehr at the Northbrook
railway station.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I catch them hanging around Thessa,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll certainly beat them up, Garry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deal with anything of that sort directly; that&#8217;s always
the best way. No use arguing with a Hun. When
he misbehaves, beat him up. It&#8217;s the only thing he understands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all right for us to do it now, as long as
the French Government knows where Thessa is,&#8221; remarked
Barres, drawing a white clove-carnation
through his buttonhole. &#8220;But what do you think of
that dirty swine, Tauscher, planning wholesale murder
like that? Isn&#8217;t it the fine flower of Prussianism?
There&#8217;s the real and porcine boche for you, sombre,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
savage, stupidly ferocious, swinishly persistent, but
never quite cunning enough, never sufficiently subtle
in planning his filthy and murderous holocausts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore nodded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right. The <i>Lusitania</i> and Belgium cost the
Hun the respect of civilisation, and are driving the
civilised world into a common understanding. We&#8217;ll go
in before long; don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>They descended the stairs together just as dinner
was announced.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barres said laughingly to her son:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father is still fishing, I suppose, so in spite of
his admonition to me by letter this morning, I sent over
one of the men with some thermos bottles and a very
nice supper. He grumbles, but he always likes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what Mr. Barres will think of me,&#8221; ventured
Dulcie. &#8220;He left such a pretty little rod for
me. Thessa and I have been examining it. I&#8217;d like
to go, only&mdash;&#8221; she added with a wistful smile, &#8220;I have
never been to a real party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re going to the Gerhardts&#8217;,&#8221; insisted
Lee, laughing. &#8220;Dad is absurd about his fishing. I
don&#8217;t believe any girl ever lived who&#8217;d prefer fishing
on that foggy lake at night to dancing at such a party
as you are going to to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going?&#8221; asked Thessalie, but Lee shook
her head, still smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have two young setters down with distemper,
and mother and I always sit up with our dogs under
such circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personal devotion of this sort was new to Thessalie.
Mrs. Barres and Lee told her all about the dreaded
contagion and how very dreadful an epidemic might
be in a kennel of such finely bred dogs as was the well-known
Foreland Kennels.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></div>
<p>Dog talk absorbed everybody during dinner. Mrs.
Barres and Lee were intensely interested in Thessalie&#8217;s
description of the Grand Duke Cyril&#8217;s Russian wolfhounds,
with which she had coursed and hunted as a
child.</p>
<p>Once she spoke, also, of those strange, pathetic,
melancholy Ishmaelites, pitiable outcasts of their race&mdash;the
pariah dogs of Constantinople. For, somehow,
while dressing that evening, the distant complaint of a
tethered beagle had made her think of Stamboul. And
she remembered that night so long ago on the moonlit
deck of the <i>Mirage</i>, where she had stood with Ferez
Bey while, from the unseen, monstrous city close at
hand, arose the endless wailing of homeless dogs.</p>
<p>How strange it was, too, to think that the owner of
the <i>Mirage</i> should this night be her host here in the
Western World, yet remain unconscious that he had
ever before entertained her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Before coffee had been served in the entrance hall,
the kennel master sent in word that one of the pups,
a promising Blue Belton, had turned very sick indeed,
and would Mrs. Barres come to the kennels as soon as
convenient.</p>
<p>It was enough for Mrs. Barres and for Lee; they
both excused themselves without further ceremony and
went away together to the kennels, apparently quite
oblivious of their delicate dinner gowns and slippers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen my mother ruin many a gown on such errands,&#8221;
remarked Garry, smiling. &#8220;No use offering
yourself as substitute; my mother would as soon abandon
her own sick baby to strangers as turn over an
ailing pup to anybody except Lee and herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is very splendid,&#8221; murmured Dulcie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
relinquishing her coffee cup to Garry and suffering
a maid to invest her with a scarf and light silk wrap.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother <i>is</i> splendid,&#8221; said Garry in a low voice.
&#8220;You will see her prove it some day, I hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl turned her lovely head, curiously, not understanding.
Garry laughed, but his voice was not
quite steady when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;But it all depends on you, Dulcie, how splendid
my mother may prove herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On your&mdash;kindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;<i>kindness</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie came up in her pretty carnation-rose cloak,
esquired by the enraptured Westmore, expressing admiration
for the clothing adorning the very obvious
object of his devotion:</p>
<p>&#8220;All girls can&#8217;t wear a thing like that cloak,&#8221; he was
explaining proudly; &#8220;now it would look like the devil
on you, Dulcie, with your coppery hair and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What exquisite tact!&#8221; shrugged Thessalie, already
a trifle restive under his constant attendance and unremitting
admiration. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you, out of your richly
redundant vocabulary, find something civil to say to
Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dulcie, still preoccupied with what Barres had
said, merely gave her an absent-minded smile and walked
slowly out beside her to the porch, where the headlights
of a touring car threw two broad beams of gold
across the lawn.</p>
<p>It was a swift, short run through the valley northward
among the hills, and very soon the yellow lights
of Northbrook summer homes dotted the darkness
ahead, and cars were speeding in from every direction&mdash;from
Ilderness, Wythem, East and South Gorloch&mdash;carrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
guests for the Gerhardts&#8217; moonlight spectacle
and dance.</p>
<p>Apropos of the promised spectacle, Barres observed
to Dulcie that there happened to be no moon, and consequently
no moonlight, but the girl, now delightfully
excited by glimpses of Hohenlinden festooned with
electricity, gaily reproached him for being literal.</p>
<p>&#8220;If one is happy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a word is enough to
satisfy one&#8217;s imagination. If they call it a moonlight
spectacle, I shall certainly see moonlight whether it&#8217;s
there or not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may call it heaven, too, if they like,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll believe it&mdash;if you are there.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that she blushed furiously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry! You don&#8217;t mean it, and it&#8217;s silly to say
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it all right,&#8221; he muttered, as the car swung
in through the great ornamental gates of Hohenlinden.
&#8220;The trouble is that I mean so much&mdash;and <i>you</i> mean
so much to me&mdash;that I don&#8217;t know how to express it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl, her face charmingly aglow, looked straight
in front of her out of enchanted eyes, but her heart&#8217;s
soft violence in her breast left her breathless and mute;
and when the car stopped she scarcely dared rest her
hand on the arm which Barres presented to guide her
in her descent to earth.</p>
<p>It may have been partly the magnificence of Hohenlinden
that so thrillingly overwhelmed her as she
seated herself with Garry on the marble terrace of an
amphitheatre among brilliant throngs already gathered
to witness the eagerly discussed spectacle.</p>
<p>And it really was a bewilderingly beautiful scene,
there under the summer stars, where a thousand rosy
lanterns hung tinting the still waters of the little stream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
that wound through the clipped greensward which
was the stage.</p>
<p>The foliage of a young woodland walled in this vernal
scene; the auditorium was a semi-circle of amber marble&mdash;rows
of low benches, tier on tier, rising to a level
with the lawn above.</p>
<p>The lantern light glowed on pretty shoulders and
bare arms, on laces and silks and splendid jewels, and
stained the sombre black of the men with vague warm
hues of rose.</p>
<p>Westmore, leaning over to address Barres, said with
an amused air:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Garry, it&#8217;s Corot Mandel who is putting
on this thing for the Gerhardts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I know it,&#8221; nodded Barres. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t he
try to get Thessa for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie, whose colour was high and whose dark
eyes, roaming, had grown very brilliant, suddenly held
out her hand to one of two men who, traversing the inclined
aisle beside her, halted to salute her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your name was on our lips,&#8221; she said gaily. &#8220;How
do you do, Mr. Mandel! How do you do, Mr. Trenor!
Are you going to amaze us with a miracle in this
enchanting place?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men paid their respects to her, and, with
unfeigned astonishment and admiration, to Dulcie,
whom they recognised only when Thessalie named her
with delighted malice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Miss Soane,&#8221; began Mandel, leaning on
the back of the marble seat, &#8220;you and Miss Dunois
might have helped me a lot if I&#8217;d known you were
to be in this neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Esmé Trenor bent over Barres, dropping his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to use a couple of Broadway hacks&mdash;you&#8217;ll
recognise &#8217;em through their paint&mdash;you understand?&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
two that New York screams for. It&#8217;s too bad.
Corot wanted something unfamiliarly beautiful and
young and fresh. But these Northbrook amateurs are
incredibly amateurish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie was chattering away with Corot Mandel
and Westmore; Esmé Trenor gazed upon Dulcie in
wonder not unmixed with chagrin:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve never forgiven me, Dulcie, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; she inquired indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;For not discovering you when I should have.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled, but the polite effort and her detachment
of all interest in him were painfully visible to Esmé.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you still remember me so unkindly,&#8221; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I never do remember you at all,&#8221; she explained
so candidly that Barres was obliged to avert his
amused face, and Esmé Trenor reddened to the roots
of his elaborate hair. Mandel, with a wry grin, linked
his arm in Trenor&#8217;s and drew him away toward the
flight of steps which was the stage entrance to the
dressing rooms below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; he said, waving his hat. &#8220;Hope you&#8217;ll
like my moonlight frolic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your bally moon!&#8221; demanded Westmore.</p>
<p>As he spoke, an unseen orchestra began to play &#8220;<i>Au
Claire de la Lune</i>,&#8221; and, behind the woods, silhouetting
every trunk and branch and twig, the glittering edge
of a huge, silvery moon appeared.</p>
<p>Slowly it rose, flashing a broad path of light across
the lawn, reflected in the still little river. And when it
was in the position properly arranged for it, some local
Joshua&mdash;probably Corot Mandel&mdash;arrested its further
motion, and it hung there, flooding the stage with a
witching lustre.</p>
<p>All at once the stage swarmed with supple, glimmering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
shapes: Oberon and Titania came flitting down
through the trees; Puck, scintillating like a dragon-fly,
dropped on the sward, seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>It was a wonderfully beautiful ballet, with an unseen
chorus singing from within the woods like a thousand
seraphim.</p>
<p>As for the play itself, which began with the calm
and silvered river suddenly swarming alive with water-nymphs,
it had to do, spasmodically, with the love of
the fairy crown-prince for the very attractive water-nymph,
Ythali. This nimble lady, otherwise, was
fiercely wooed by the King of the Mud-turtles, a most
horrid and sprawling shape, but a clever foil&mdash;with
his army of river-rats, minks and crabs&mdash;to the
nymphs and wood fairies.</p>
<p>Also, the music was refreshingly charming, the singing
excellent, and the story interesting enough to keep
the audience amused until the end.</p>
<p>There was, of course, much moonlight dancing, much
frolicking in the water, few clothes on the Broadway
principals, fewer on the chorus, and apparently no
scruples about discarding even these.</p>
<p>But the whole spectacle was so unreal, so spectral,
that its shadowy beauty robbed it of offence.</p>
<p>That sort of thing had made Corot Mandel famous.
He calculated to the width of a moonbeam just how
far he could go. And he never went a hair&#8217;s breadth
farther.</p>
<p>Thessalie looked on with flushed cheeks and parted
lips, absorbed in it all with the savant eyes of a professional.
She also had once coolly decided how far
her beauty and talent and adolescent effrontery could
carry her gay disdain of man. And she had flouted him
with indifferent eyes and dainty nose uplifted&mdash;mocked
him and his conventions, with a few roubles in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
dressing-room&mdash;slapped the collective face of his sex
with her insolent loveliness, and careless smile.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as she sat there watching the fairy scene,
she remembered her ostrich and the German Embassy,
and the aged Von-der-Goltz Pasha, all over jewels and
gold, peeping at her through thick spectacles under his
red fez.</p>
<p>Perhaps she thought of Ferez, too, and maybe it
was thought of him that caused her smooth young
shoulders the slightest of shivers, as though a harsh
breeze had chilled her skin.</p>
<p>As for Dulcie, she was in the seventh heaven, thrilled
with the dreamy beauty of it all and the exquisite phantoms
floating on the greensward under her enraptured
eyes.</p>
<p>No other thought possessed her save sheer delight in
this revelation of pure enchantment.</p>
<p>So intent, so still she became, leaning a little forward
in her place, that Barres found her far more interesting
and wonderful to watch than Mandel&#8217;s cunningly
contrived illusions in the artificial moonlight below.</p>
<p>And now Titania&#8217;s trumpets sounded from the woods,
warning all of the impending dawn. Suddenly the
magic fairy moon vanished like the flame of a blown-out
candle; a faint, rosy light grew through the trees, revealing
an empty stage and a river on which floated
a single swan.</p>
<p>Then, from somewhere, a distant cock-crow rang
through the dawn. The play was ended.</p>
<p>Two splendid orchestras were alternating on the vast
marble terraces of Hohenlinden, where hundreds of
dancers moved under the white radiance of a huge
silvery moon overhead&mdash;another contrivance of
Mandel&#8217;s&mdash;for the splendid sphere aglow with white
fire had somehow been suspended above the linden trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
so that no poles and no wires were visible against the
starry sky.</p>
<p>And in its milky flood of light the dancers moved
amid a wilderness of flowers or thronged the supper-rooms
within, where Teutonic architectural and decorative
magnificence reigned in one vast, incredible, indigestible
gastronomic apotheosis of German kultur.</p>
<p>Barres, for the moment, dancing with Thessalie,
pressed her fingers with mischievous tenderness and
whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;The moonlit way once more with you, Thessa! Do
you remember our first dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I ever thank God enough for that night&#8217;s
folly!&#8221; she said, with such sudden emotion that his
smile altered as he looked into her dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet that dance by moonlight exiled you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you realise what it saved me from, too? And
what it has given me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered whether she included Westmore in the
gift. The music ceased at that moment, and, though
the other orchestra began, they strolled along the
flowering balustrade of the terrace together until they
encountered Dulcie and Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you spoken to your hostess?&#8221; inquired Westmore.
&#8220;She&#8217;s over yonder on a dais, enthroned like
Germania or a Metropolitan Opera Valkyrie. Dulcie
and I have paid our homage.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Barres and Thessalie went away to comply with
the required formality; and, when they returned from
the rite, they found Esmé Trenor and Corot Mandel
cornering Dulcie under a flowering orange tree while
Westmore, beside her, chatted with a most engaging
woman who proved, later, to be a practising physician.</p>
<p>Esmé was saying languidly, that anybody could fly
into a temper and kick his neighbours, but that indifference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
to physical violence was a condition of mind
attained only by the spiritual intellect of the psychic
adept.</p>
<p>&#8220;Passivism,&#8221; he added with a wave of his lank
fingers, &#8220;is the first plane to be attained on the journey
toward Nirvana. Therefore, I am a pacifist and this
silly war does not interest me in the slightest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very engaging woman, who had been chatting
with Westmore, looked around at Esmé Trenor, evidently
much amused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagined that you were a pacifist,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
fancy, Mr. Mandel, also, is one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, I am, madam!&#8221; said Corot Mandel. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
plenty to do in life without strutting around and
bawling for blood at the top of my lungs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank heaven,&#8221; added Esmé, &#8220;the President has
kept us out of war. This business of butchering others
never appealed to me&mdash;except for the slightly unpleasant
sensations which I experience when I read the details.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. Then unpleasant sensations so appeal to
you?&#8221; inquired Westmore, very red.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they <i>are</i> sensations, you know,&#8221; drawled
Esmé. &#8220;And, for a man who experiences few sensations
of any sort, even unpleasant ones are pleasurable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandel yawned and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The war is an outrageous bore. All wars are stupid
to a man of temperament. Therefore, I&#8217;m a pacifist.
And I had rather live under Prussian domination
than rush about the country with a gun and sixty
pounds of luggage on my back!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked heavily at Dulcie, who had slipped out
of the corner on the terrace, where he and Esmé had
penned her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There are other things to do more interesting than
jabbing bayonets into Germans,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Did
you say you hadn&#8217;t any dance to spare us, Miss Soane?
Nor you either, Miss Dunois? Oh, well.&#8221; He cast a
disgusted glance at Barres, squinted at Westmore
through his greasy monocle in hostile silence; then,
taking Esmé&#8217;s arm, made them all a too profound
obeisance and sauntered away along the terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pair of beasts!&#8221; said Westmore. &#8220;They
make me actually ill!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres shrugged and turned to the very engaging
lady beside him:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of that breed of human, doctor?&#8221;
he inquired.</p>
<p>She smiled at Barres and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Several of my own patients who are suffering from
the same form of psycho-neurotic trouble are also
peace-at-any-price pacifists. They do not come to me
to be cured of their pacifism. On the contrary, they
cherish it most tenderly. In examining them for other
troubles I happened upon what appeared to me a very
close relation between the peculiar attitude of the
peace-at-any-price pacifist and a certain type of unconscious
pervert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That passivism is perversion does not surprise me,&#8221;
remarked Barres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the pacifist is not conscious of
his real desires and therefore cannot be termed a true
pervert. But the very term, passivism, is usually significant
and goes very deep psychologically. In analysing
my patients I struck against a buried impulse
in them to suffer tyrannous treatment from an omnipotent
master. The impulse was so strong that it
amounted to a craving and tried to absorb all the
psychic material within its reach. They did not recognise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
the original impulse, because that had long ago
been crushed down by the exactions of civilised life.
Nevertheless, they were tortured and teased, made unsettled
and wretched by a something which continually
baffled them. Deep under the upper crust of
their personalities was concealed a seething desire to
be completely, inevitably, relentlessly, unreservedly
overwhelmed by a subjugation from which there was
no escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to Westmore:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s purely pathological, the condition of those two
self-confessed pacifists. The pacifist loves suffering.
The ordinary normal person avoids suffering when possible.
He endures it only when something necessary
or desirable cannot be gained in any other way. He
may undergo agony at the mere thought of it. His
bravery consists in facing danger and pain in spite
of fear. But the extreme passivist, who is really an
unconscious pervert, loves to dream of martyrdom
and suffering. It must be a suffering, however, which
is forced upon him, and it must be a personal matter,
not impersonal and general, as in war. And he loves
to contemplate a condition of complete captivity&mdash;of
irresponsible passivity, in which all resistance is in
vain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, they disgust me, those two!&#8221; said
Westmore angrily. &#8220;I never could endure anything
abnormal. And now that I know Esmé is&mdash;and that
big lout, Mandel&mdash;I&#8217;ll keep away from them. Do you
blame me, doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, much amused and turning to go,
&#8220;they&#8217;re very interesting to physicians, you know&mdash;these
non-resisting, pacifistic perverts. But outside a
sanatorium I shouldn&#8217;t expect them to be very popular.&#8221;
And she laughed and joined a big, good-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
man who had come to seek her, and who wore, in his
buttonhole, the button of the French Legion of Honour.</p>
<p>Thessalie had strolled forward along the terrace by
herself, interested in the pretty spectacle and the play
of light on jewels and gowns.</p>
<p>Westmore, busy in expressing to Barres his opinion
of Esmé and Mandel, did not at the moment miss Thessalie,
who continued to saunter on along the balustrade
of the terrace, under the blossoming row of
orange trees.</p>
<p>Just below her was another terrace and an oval
pool set with tiny jets which seemed to spray the basin
with liquid silver. Silvery fish, too, were swimming in
it near the surface, sometimes flinging themselves clear
out of water as though intoxicated by the unwonted
lustre which flooded their crystal pool.</p>
<p>To see them nearer, Thessalie ran lightly down the
steps and walked toward the shimmering basin. And
at the same time the head and shoulders of a man in
evening dress, his bosom crossed by a sash of watered
red silk, appeared climbing nimbly from a still lower
level.</p>
<p>She watched him step swiftly upon the terrace and
cross it diagonally, walking in her direction toward the
stone stairs which she had just descended. Then, paying
him no further attention, she looked down into the
water.</p>
<p>He came along very near to where she stood, gazing
into the pool&mdash;peered at her curiously&mdash;was already
passing at her very elbow&mdash;when something made
her lift her head and look around at him.</p>
<p>The mock moonlight struck full across his features;
and the shock of seeing him drove every vestige of colour
from her own face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></div>
<p>The man halted, staring at her in unfeigned amazement.
Suddenly he snarled at her, baring his teeth
in her shrinking face.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Kismet dir!</i>&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;it ees <i>you</i>!...
Nihla Quellen! <i>Now</i> I begin onderstan&#8217;!... Yas, I
now onderstan&#8217; who arrange it that they haf arrest my
good frien&#8217;, Tauscher! It ees <i>you</i>, then! Von Igel
he has tol&#8217; me, look out once eef she escape&mdash;thees
yoong leopardess&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez!&#8221; Thessalie&#8217;s young figure stiffened and the
colour flamed in her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leopardess!&#8221; he repeated, every tooth a-grin
again with rage, &#8220;you misbegotten slut of a hunting
cheetah! So thees is &#8217;ow you strike!... Ver&#8217; well.
Yas, I see &#8217;ow it ees you strike at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Listen to <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ear you! Allez!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez Bey! I am not afraid of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ees it so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is so. I <i>never</i> have been afraid of you!
Not even there on the deck of the <i>Mirage</i>, that night
when you tapped the hilt of your Kurdish knife and
spoke of Seraglio Point! Nor when your scared spy
shot at me in the corridor of the Tenth Street house;
nor afterward at Dragon Court! Nor now! Do you
understand, Eurasian jackal! Nor <i>now</i>! Anybody
can see what <i>Heruli</i> whelped you! What are you doing
in America? Kassim Pasha is your den, where your
<i>rayah</i> loll and scratch in the sun! It is their <i>Keyeff</i>!
And yours!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took a quick step toward him, her eyes flashing,
her white hand clenched:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Allah Kerim</i>&mdash;do you say? <i>El Hamdu Lillah!</i>
Do you take yourself for the <i>muezzin</i> of all jackals,
then, howling blasphemies from some <i>minaret</i> in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
hills? Do you understand what they&#8217;d do to you in
the <i>Hirka-i-Sherif Jamesi</i>? Because you are <i>nothing</i>;
do you hear?&mdash;nothing but an Eurasian assassin!
And Moslem and Christian alike know where <i>you</i> belong
among the lost pariahs of Stamboul!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was utterly transfigured. Whatever of the
Orient was in her, now blazed white hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I done to you, Ferez? What have I
ever done to you that you, even from my childhood,
come always stepping noiselessly at my skirt&#8217;s edge?&mdash;always
padding behind me at my heels, silent, sinister,
whimpering with bared teeth for the courage to
bite which God denies you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stood almost motionless, moistening his
dry lips with his tongue, but his eyes moved continually,
stealing uneasy glances around him and upward,
where, on the main terrace above them, the heads of
the throng passed and repassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for all thees scorn and abuse of
me, you know, in the false heart of you, why it ees so
if I have seek you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dealer in lies! You would have sold me to
d&#8217;Eblis! You thought you <i>had</i> sold me! You were
paid for it, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; still!&#8221; He looked at her furtively.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? You conspired with d&#8217;Eblis
to ruin me, soul and body! You involved me in your
treacherous propaganda in Paris. Through you I am
an exile. If I go back to my own country, I shall
go to a shameful death. You have blackened my honour
in my country&#8217;s eyes. But that was not enough.
No! You thought me sufficiently broken, degraded,
terrified to listen to any proposition from you. You
sent your agents to me with offers of money if I would
betray my country. Finding I would not, you whined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
and threatened. Then, like the Eurasian dog you are,
you tried to bargain. You were eager to offer me
anything if I would keep quiet and not interfere&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nihla!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she said, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;In spite of thees&mdash;of all you say&mdash;I have love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liar!&#8221; she retorted wrathfully. &#8220;Do you dare say
that to me, whom you have already tried to murder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say it. Yas. Eef it has not been so then you
were dead long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you are trying to tell me that you spared
me!&#8221; she demanded scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ees so. Alexandre&mdash;d&#8217;Eblis, you know?&mdash;long
time since he would have safety for us all&mdash;thees way.
Non! Je ne pourrais pas vouz tuer, moi! It ees not
in my heart, Nihla.... Because I have love you long
time&mdash;ver&#8217; long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have <i>feared</i> me long time, ver&#8217; long
time!&#8221; she mocked him. &#8220;That is why, Ferez&mdash;because
you are afraid; because you are only a jackal. And
jackals never kill. No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say thees-a to me, Nihla?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I say it. You&#8217;re a coward! And I&#8217;ll tell you
something more. I am going to make a complete
statement to the French Government. I shall relate
everything I know about d&#8217;Eblis, Bolo Effendi, a certain
bureaucrat, an Italian politician, a Swiss banker,
old Von-der-Goltz Pasha, Heimholz, Von-der-Hohe
Pasha, and you, my Ferez&mdash;and you, also!</p>

HE CAME TOWARD HER STEALTHILY<br />

</div>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what France will do to d&#8217;Eblis and
his scoundrel friends? Do you guess what these duped
Americans will do to Bolo Effendi? And to you? And
to Von Papen and Boy-ed and Von Igel&mdash;yes, and to
Bernstorff and his whole murderous herd of Germans?
And can you imagine what my own doubly duped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
Government will surely, surely do, some day, to you,
Ferez?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, but her dark eyes fairly glittered:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> martyrdom is ending, God be thanked! And
then I shall be free to serve where my heart is ... in
Alsace!... Alsace!&mdash;forever French!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the white light she saw the sweat break out on
the man&#8217;s forehead&mdash;saw him grope for his handkerchief&mdash;and
draw out a knife instead&mdash;never taking
his eyes off her.</p>
<p>She turned to run; but he had already blocked the
way to the stone steps; and now he came creeping
toward her, white as a cadaver, distracted from sheer
terror, and rubbing the knife flat against his thigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you shall do thees&mdash;a filth to me&mdash;eh, Nihla?&#8221;
he whispered with blanched lips. &#8220;It ees on me, your
frien&#8217;, you spring to keel me, eh, my leopardess? Ver&#8217;
well. But firs&#8217; I teach you somethings you don&#8217; know!&mdash;thees-a
way, my Nihla!&#8221;</p>
<p>He came toward her stealthily, moving more swiftly
as she put the stone basin of the pool between them
and cast an agonised glance up at the distant terrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; she cried frantically. &#8220;Jim! Help me,
Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gay din of the music above drowned her cry;
she fled as Ferez darted toward her, but again he
doubled and sprang back to bar the stone steps, and
she halted, white and breathless, yet poised for instant
flight.</p>
<p>Again and again she called out desperately for aid;
the noise of the orchestra smothered her cry. And
if, indeed, anybody from the terrace above chanced to
glance down, it is likely that they supposed these two
were skylarking merrymakers at some irresponsible
game of catch-who-can.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span></div>
<p>Suddenly Thessalie remembered the lower level,
where the automobiles were parked, and from which
Ferez had first appeared. She could escape that way.
There were the steps, not very far behind her. The
next instant she turned and ran like a deer.</p>
<p>And after her sped Ferez, his broad, thin-bladed
knife pressed flat against the crimson sash across his
breast, his dead-white visage distorted with that blind,
convulsive fear which makes murderers out of cowards.</p>

<h2>XXVIII
<span class='chsub'> <br /><br />GREEN JACKETS</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Thoroughly worried by this time over the
sudden disappearance of Thessalie Dunois, and
unable to discover her anywhere on the terrace
or in the house, Westmore, Barres and Dulcie Soane
had followed the winding main drive as far as the level,
where their car was waiting among scores of other
cars.</p>
<p>But Thessalie was not there; the chauffeur had not
seen her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where in the world could she have gone?&#8221; faltered
Dulcie. &#8220;She was standing up there on the terrace
with us, a moment ago; then, the very next second, she
had vanished utterly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore, grim and pallid, walked back along the
drive; Dulcie followed with Barres. As they overtook
Westmore, he cast one more glance back at the ranks
of waiting cars, then stared up at the terraced hill
above them, over which the artificial moon hung above
the lindens, glowing with pallid, lambent fires.</p>
<p>There was a vague whitish object on one of the
grassy slopes&mdash;something in motion up there&mdash;something
that was running erratically but swiftly&mdash;as
though in pursuit&mdash;or <i>pursued</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! What&#8217;s that, Garry!&#8221; he burst out.
&#8220;That thing up there on the hillside!&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang for the steps, Barres after him, taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
the ascent at incredible speed, up, up, then out along
a shrub-set grassy slope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa!&#8221; shouted Westmore. &#8220;Thessa!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the girl was flat on her back on the grass now,
fighting sturdily for life&mdash;twisting, striking, baffling
the whining, panting thing that knelt on her, holding
her and trying to drive a knife deep into the lithe
young body which always slipped and writhed out of
his trembling clutch.</p>
<p>Again and again he tore himself free from her grasp;
again and again his armed hand sought to strike, but
she always managed to seize and drag it aside with
the terrible strength of one dying. And at last, with
a last crazed, superhuman effort, she wrested the knife
from his unnerved fist, tore it out of his spent fingers.</p>
<p>It fell somewhere near her on the grass; he strove
to reach it and pick it up, but already her dauntless
resistance began to exhaust him, and he groped for the
knife in vain, trying to pin her down with one hand
while, with desperate little fists, she rained blows on
his bloodless face that dazed him.</p>
<p>But there was still another way&mdash;a much better way,
in fact. And, as the idea came to him, he ripped the
red-silk sash from his breast and, in spite of her struggles,
managed to pass it around her bare neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;I keep my word at last. C&#8217;est
fini, ma petite Nihla.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim! Help me!&#8221; she gasped, as Ferez pulled savagely
at the silk noose, tightened it with all his
strength, knotted it. And in that same second he
heard Westmore crashing through the shrubbery, close
to him.</p>
<p>Instantly he rose to his knees on the grass; bounded
to his feet, leaped over the low shrubs, and was off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
down the slope&mdash;gone like a swift hawk&#8217;s shadow on
the hillside. Barres was after him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The soul of Thessalie Dunois was very near to its
escape, now, brightening, glistening within its unconscious
chrysalis, stretching its glorious limbs and
wings; preparing to arise from its spectral tenement
and soar aloft to its myriad sisters, where they
swarmed glittering in the zenith.</p>
<p>Had it not been for the knife lying beside her on
the grass&mdash;the blade very bright in the starlight&mdash;truly
the youthful soul of Thessalie had been sped.</p>
<p>At the edge of the Gerhardts&#8217; pine woods, Barres,
at fault, baffled, furious, out of breath and glaring
around him in the dark, sullenly gave up the hopeless
chase, turned in his tracks, and came back. Thessalie,
lying in Dulcie&#8217;s arms, unclosed her eyes and looked
up at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; he asked, kneeling and bending
over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... Jim came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore&#8217;s voice was shaky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We worked her arms&mdash;Dulcie and I&mdash;started respiration.
She was nearly gone. That beast strangled
her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost him in those woods below. Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez Bey!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thessalie sighed, closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s about all in,&#8221; whispered Westmore. And, to
Dulcie: &#8220;Let me take her. I&#8217;ll carry her to the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that Thessalie opened her eyes again and the
old, faintly humorous smile glimmered out at him as
he stooped and lifted her from the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I really trust myself to your arms, Jim?&#8221; she
murmured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get used to &#8217;em,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
never get away from them again&mdash;I can tell you that
right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.... In that case, I hope they&#8217;ll be&mdash;comfortable&mdash;your
arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think they will be, Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221; She gazed into his eyes very seriously
from where she lay cradled in his powerful arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, Jim.... So sore and bruised....
When he was choking me I tried to think of you&mdash;believing
it was the end&mdash;my last conscious thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; she breathed, &#8220;so lonely.... I
shall be&mdash;contented&mdash;in your arms.... Always&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She turned her head and rested her cheek against his
breast with a deep sigh.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He held her in his arms in the car all the way to
Foreland Farms. Dulcie, however, had possessed herself
of Thessalie&#8217;s left hand, and when she stroked it
and pressed it to her lips the girl&#8217;s tightening fingers
responded, and she always smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just tired and sore,&#8221; she explained languidly.
&#8220;Ferez battered me about so dreadfully!... It was
so mortifying. I despised him all the time. It made
me furious to be handled by such a contemptible and
cowardly creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a matter for the police, now,&#8221; remarked Barres
gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;What a very horrid
ending to the moonlit way we took together so long
ago!&mdash;the lovely silvery path of Pierrot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The story of Pierrot is a tragedy, Thessa! We
have been luckier on our moonlit way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Than Pierrot and Pierrette?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Death always saunters along the path of
the moon, watching for those who take it.... You
are very fortunate, Pierrette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I am fortunate.... Am I
not, Jim?&#8221; she added, looking up wistfully into his
shadowy face above her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but there&#8217;ll be
no more moonlight business for you unless I&#8217;m with
you. And under those circumstances,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
knock the block off Old Man Death if he tries to flirt
with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How brutal! Garry, do you hear his language to
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear,&#8221; said Barres, laughing. &#8220;Your young man
is a very matter of fact young man, Thessa, and I
fancy he means what he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at Westmore; her lips barely moved:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I do,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pull this planet
to pieces looking for you if you ever again steal away
to a rendezvous with Old Man Death.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the car arrived at Foreland Farms, Thessalie
felt able to proceed to her room upon her own legs,
and with Dulcie&#8217;s arm around her.</p>
<p>Westmore bade her good-night, kissing her hand&mdash;awkwardly&mdash;not
being convincing in any rôle requiring
attitudes.</p>
<p>He wanted to take her into his arms, but seemed
to know enough not to do it. Probably she divined
his irresolute state of mind, for she extended her hand
in a pretty manner quite unmistakable. And the romantic
education of James H. Westmore began.</p>
<p>Barres lingered at the door after Westmore departed,
obeying a whispered aside from Dulcie. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
came out in a few moments, carefully closing the bedroom
door, and stood so, one hand behind her still resting
on the knob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thessa is crying. It&#8217;s only the natural relaxation
from that horrible tension. I shall sleep with her to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. She will be all right.... Garry, are
they&mdash;are they&mdash;in <i>love</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It rather looks that way, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>She gazed at him questioningly, almost fearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> believe that Thessa is in love with Mr.
Westmore?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.... I thought so. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;didn&#8217;t know&mdash;what you would think of
it.... I was afraid it might&mdash;might make you&mdash;unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>care</i> if Thessa loves somebody else?&#8221;
she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think I did, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a strained silence; then the girl smiled at
him in a confused manner, drew a swift, sudden breath,
and, as he stepped forward to detain her, turned
sharply away, pressing her forearm across her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie! Did you understand me?&#8221; he said in a low,
unsteady voice.</p>
<p>She was already trying to open the door, but he
dropped his right hand over her fingers where they
were fumbling with the knob, and felt them trembling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
At the same moment, the sound of Thessalie&#8217;s smothered
and convulsive sobbing came to him; and Dulcie&#8217;s
nervous hand slipped from his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Will you come back to me
if I wait?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had stopped; her back was still toward him, but
she nodded slightly, then moved on toward the bed,
where Thessalie lay all huddled up, her face buried in
the tumbled pillows.</p>
<p>Barres noiselessly closed the door.</p>
<p>He had already started along the corridor toward
his own room, when the low sound of voices in the staircase
hall just below arrested his attention&mdash;his sister&#8217;s
voice and Westmore&#8217;s. And he retraced his steps
and went down to where they stood together by the
library door.</p>
<p>Lee wore a nurse&#8217;s dress and apron, such as a kennel-mistress
affects, and her strong, capable hands were
full of bottles labelled &#8220;Grover&#8217;s Specific&#8221;&mdash;the same
being dog medicine of various sorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother is over at the kennels, Garry,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;She and I are going to sit up with those desperately
sick pups. If we can pull them through to-night they&#8217;ll
probably get well, eventually, unless paralysis sets in.
I was just telling Jim that a very attractive young
Frenchman was here only a few minutes before you arrived.
His name is Renoux. And he left this letter
for you&mdash;fish it out of my apron pocket, there&#8217;s a
dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her brother drew out the letter; his sister said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Renoux went away in a car with two other men.
He asked me to say to you that there was no time to
lose&mdash;whatever he meant by that! Now, I must hurry
away!&#8221; She turned and sped through the hall and
out through the swinging screen door on the north
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
porch. Garry had already opened the note from
Renoux, glanced over it; then he read it aloud to Westmore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>My dear Comrade</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fat&#8217;s in the fire! Your agents took Tauscher in
charge to-day. Max Freund and Franz Lehr have just
been arrested by your excellent Postal authorities. Warrants
are out for Sendelbeck, Johann Klein, and Louis
Hochstein. I think the latter are making for Mexico,
but your Secret Service people are close on their heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recall for von Papen and Boy-ed is certain to be demanded
by your Government. Mine will look after Bolo
Effendi and d&#8217;Eblis and their international gang of spies
and crooks. Ferez Bey, however, still eludes us. He is
somewhere in this vicinity, but of course, even when we
locate him again, we can&#8217;t touch him. All we can do is
to point him out to your Government agents, who will then
keep him in sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far so good. But now I am forced to ask a very
great favour of you, and, if I may, of your friend, Mr.
Westmore. It is this: Skeel, contrary to what was expected
of him, did not go to the place which is being
watched. Nor have any of his men appeared at that rendezvous
where there lies the very swift and well-armed
launch, <i>Togue Rouge</i>, which we had every reason to suppose
was to be their craft in this outrageous affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, this launch is Tauscher&#8217;s. But it,
and the pretended rendezvous, are what you call a plant.
Skeel never intended to assemble his men there; never
intended to use that particular launch. Tauscher merely
planted it. Your men and the Canadian agents, unfortunately,
are covering that vicinity and are still watching
for Skeel, who has a very different plan in his crazy head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, this is Skeel&#8217;s plan, and this is the situation,
learned by me from papers discovered on Tauscher:</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosives bought and sent there by Tauscher himself
are on a big, fast power-boat which is lying at anchor
in a little cove called Saibling Bay. The boat flies the
Quebec Yacht Club ensign, and a private pennant to which
it has no right.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Two of Skeel&#8217;s gang are already aboard&mdash;a man named
Con McDermott and another, Kelly Walsh. Skeel joins
the others at a hamlet near the Lake shore, known as Three
Ponds. The tavern is a notorious and disreputable old
brick hotel&mdash;what you call a speak-easy. That is their
rendezvous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I have wired to your people, to Canada, to
Washington. But Three Ponds is not a very long drive
from here, if one ignores speed limits. Yes? Could you
help us maintain a close surveillance over that damned
tavern to-night? Is it too much to ask?</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you and Mr. Westmore are graciously inclined
to aid us, would you be so kind as to come armed? Because,
mon ami, unless your Government people arrive in
time, I shall certainly try to keep Skeel and his gang
from boarding that boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Au revoir, donc! I am off with Jacques Alost and
Emile Souchez for that charming summer resort, the Three
Ponds Tavern, where, from the neighbouring roadside
woods, I shall hope to flag your automobile by sunrise
and welcome you and your amiable friend, Mr. Westmore,
as our brothers in arms.</p>
<p class='sig1'>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>Renoux</span>, your comrade and, friend.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a silence. Then Westmore looked at his
watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to hustle,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get on
some knickers and stick a couple of guns in my pocket.
You&#8217;d better telephone to the garage.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they hastened up the stairs together, Barres said:
&#8220;Have I time for a word with Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you. I&#8217;m not going to say anything
to Thessa. I wouldn&#8217;t care to miss this affair. If
we arrived too late and they had already dynamited
the Welland Canal, we&#8217;d never forgive ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres ran for his room.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They were dressed, armed and driving out of the
Foreland Farms gates inside of ten minutes. Barres
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
had the wheel; Westmore sat beside him shoving new
clips into two automatics and dividing the remaining
boxes of ammunition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crazy devils,&#8221; he said to Barres, raising his
voice to make himself heard. &#8220;Blow up the Canal,
will they! What&#8217;s the matter with these Irishmen!
The rest are not like &#8217;em. Look at the Flanders fighting,
Garry! Look at the magnificent record of the
Irish regiments! Why don&#8217;t our Irish play the
game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s their blind hatred of England,&#8221; shouted Barres,
in his ear. &#8220;They&#8217;re monomaniacs. They can&#8217;t see
anything else&mdash;can&#8217;t see what they&#8217;re doing to civilisation&mdash;cutting
the very throat of Liberty every time
they jab at England. What&#8217;s the use? You can&#8217;t
talk to them. They&#8217;re lunatics. But when they start
things over here they&#8217;ve got to be put into straitjackets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>are</i> lunatics,&#8221; repeated Westmore. &#8220;If they
weren&#8217;t, they wouldn&#8217;t risk the wholesale murder of
women and children. That is a purely German peculiarity;
it&#8217;s what the normal boche delights in. But
the Irish are white men. And it&#8217;s only when they&#8217;re
crazy they&#8217;d try a thing like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a long silence:</p>
<p>&#8220;How fast, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Around fifty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty-five miles further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The car rushed on through the night under the brilliant
July stars and over a perfect road. In the hollows,
where spring brooks ran under stone bridges, a
slight, chilling mist hung, but otherwise the night was
clear and warm.</p>
<p>Woods, fields, farms, streamed by in the darkness;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
the car tore on in the wake of its glaring, golden headlights,
where clouds of little winged creatures of the
night whirled and eddied like flecks of tinsel.</p>
<p>Rarely they encountered other cars, for the hour
was late, and there were no lights in the farm houses
which they passed along the road.</p>
<p>They spoke seldom now, their terrific speed and the
roaring wind discouraging conversation. But the
night air, which they whipped into a steadily flowing
gale, was still soft and fragrant and warm; and with
every mile their exhilaration increased.</p>
<p>Now the eastern horizon, which had already paled
to a leaden tone, was becoming pallid; and few stars
were visible except directly overhead.</p>
<p>Barres slowed down to twenty miles. Long double
barriers of dense and misty woodland flanked the road
on either hand, with few cultivated fields between and
very rarely a ramshackle barn.</p>
<p>Acres of alder swamp spread away on either hand,
set with swale and pool and tussock. And across the
flat desolation the east was all a saffron glow now,
and the fish-crows were flying in twos and threes above
the bog holes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man in the road ahead,&#8221; said Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man threw up one arm in signal, then made a
sweeping gesture indicating that they should turn
to the left. The man was Renoux.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cart-track and a pair of bars,&#8221; said Westmore.
&#8220;Their car has been in there, too. You can see the
tire marks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux sprang onto the running board without a
word.</p>
<p>Barres steered his car very gingerly in through the
bars and along the edge of the woods where, presently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
the swampy cart-track turned to the right among the
trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Renoux briskly, dropping to the
ground. He shook hands with the two new arrivals,
passed one arm under each of theirs, and led them
forward along a wet, ferny road toward a hardwood
ridge.</p>
<p>Here Souchez and Alost, who lay full length on the
dead leaves, got up, to welcome the reinforcements,
and to point out the disreputable old brick building
which stood close to the further edge of the woods,
rear end toward them, and fronting on a rutty crossroad
beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we in time?&#8221; inquired Barres in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; said Renoux with a shrug. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
been making a night of it in there. They&#8217;re at it yet.
Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even at that distance the sound of revelry was audible&mdash;shouts,
laughter, cheering, boisterous singing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skeel is there,&#8221; remarked Renoux, &#8220;and I fancy
he&#8217;s an anxious man. They ought to have been out
of that house before dawn to escape observation, but I
imagine Skeel has an unruly gang to deal with in those
reckless Irishmen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barres and Westmore peered out through the
fringe of trees across the somewhat desolate landscape
beyond.</p>
<p>There were no houses to be seen. Here and there
on the bogs were stakes of swale-hay and a gaunt tree
or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;That brick hotel,&#8221; said Renoux, &#8220;is one of those
places outside town limits, where law is defied and license
straddles the line. It&#8217;s run by McDermott, one
of the two men aboard the power-boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is their boat?&#8221; inquired Westmore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></div>
<p>Renoux turned and pointed to the southwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there in a cove&mdash;about a mile south of us.
If they leave the tavern we can get to the boat first
and block their road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be between two fires then,&#8221; observed Barres,
&#8220;from the boat&#8217;s deck and from Skeel&#8217;s gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux nodded coolly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two on the boat and five in the hotel make seven.
We are five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can hold them,&#8221; said Westmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I want,&#8221; rejoined Renoux briskly. &#8220;I
just want to check them and hold them until your
Government can send its agents here. I know I have
no business to do this&mdash;probably I&#8217;ll get into trouble.
But I can&#8217;t sit still and twirl my thumbs while people
blow up a canal belonging to an ally of France, can I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; motioned Barres. &#8220;They&#8217;re singing!
Poor devils. They&#8217;re like Cree Indians singing their
death song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Westmore sombrely, &#8220;that deep
in each man&#8217;s heart there remains a glimmer of hope
that he, at least, may come out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux shrugged:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. But they are brave, these Irish&mdash;brave
enough without a skinful of whiskey. And with it
they are entirely reckless. No sane man can foretell
what they will attempt.&#8221; He turned to include Alost
and Souchez: &#8220;I think there can be only one plan of
action for us, gentlemen. We should string out here
along the edges of the woods. When they leave the
tavern we should run for the landing and get into the
shack that stands there&mdash;a rickety sort of boat-house
on piles,&#8221; he explained to Westmore and Barres.
&#8220;There is the path through the woods.&#8221; He pointed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
the left, where a trodden way bisected the wood-road.
&#8220;It runs straight to the landing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Alost, at a sign from him, started off westward
through the woods. Souchez followed. Renoux
leaned back against a big walnut tree and signified
that he would remain there.</p>
<p>So Barres and Westmore moved forward to the
right, very cautiously, circling the rear of the old
brick hotel where a line of ruined horse-sheds and a
rickety barn screened them from view of the hotel&#8217;s
south windows.</p>
<p>So close to the tavern did they pass that they could
hear the noisy singing very distinctly and see through
the open windows the movement of shadowy figures
under the paling light of a ceiling lamp.</p>
<p>Westmore ventured nearer in hopes of getting a better
view from the horse-sheds; and Barres crept after
him through the rank growth of swale and weeds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at them!&#8221; whispered Westmore. &#8220;They&#8217;re
in a sort of uniform, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got on green jackets and stable-caps!
Do you see that stack of rifles in the corner of the
tap-room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Skeel!&#8221; muttered Westmore, &#8220;the man in
the long cloak sitting by the fireplace with his face
buried in his hands!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks utterly done in,&#8221; whispered Barres.
&#8220;Probably he can&#8217;t manage that gang and he begins
to realise it. Hark! You can hear every word of
that thing they&#8217;re singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every word, indeed, was a yell or a shout, and distinct
enough at that. They were roaring out &#8220;Green
Jackets&#8221;:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh, Irish maids love none but those</i></p>
<p><i>Who wear the jackets green!</i>&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span></div>
<p>&mdash;all lolling and carousing around a slopping wet
table&mdash;all save Murtagh Skeel, who, seated near the
empty fireplace with his white face buried between his
fingers, never stirred from his attitude of stony immobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Soane!&#8221; whispered Barres, &#8220;that man who
just got up!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Soane, his cap cocked aslant on his curly
head, his green jacket unbuttoned, a tumbler aloft in
his unsteady clutch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whurroo!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;<i>Gu ma slan a chi mi!&mdash;fear
a&#8217; Bhata!</i>&#8221; And he laid a reckless hand on Skeel&#8217;s
cloaked shoulder. But the latter never stirred; and
Soane, winking at the company, flourished his tumbler
aloft and broke into &#8220;The Risin&#8217; o&#8217; the Moon&#8221;:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>

<p>Sure it&#8217;s known to you an&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the others began to shout the words:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Death to every foe and traitor!</i></p>
<p><i>Forward! Strike the marchin&#8217; tune,</i></p>

</div></div>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to Murtagh Skeel!&#8221; roared Soane, &#8220;<i>An
gille dubh ciardubh!</i> Whurroo!&#8221;</p>
<p>Skeel lifted his haggard visage, slowly looked
around, got up from his stool.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span></div>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name,&#8221; he said hoarsely, &#8220;if you&#8217;re not
utterly shameless, take your rifles and follow me.
Look at the sun! Have you lads gone stark mad?
What will McDermott think? What will Kelly Walsh
say? It&#8217;s too late to weigh anchor now; but it isn&#8217;t
too late to go aboard and sober up, and wait for dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve a rag of patriotism left you&#8217;ll quit your
drinking and come with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sure, then, Captain dear,&#8221; cried Soane, &#8220;is
there anny harrm in a bite an&#8217; a sup f&#8217;r dyin&#8217; lads
befoor they go whizzin&#8217; up to glory?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we should be aboard! <i>Now!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, the cap&#8217;s right. To hell with the booze.
Come on, youse!&#8221; And he began to button his green
jacket. Another got up on unsteady legs:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there do be time f&#8217;r to up anchor
an&#8217; shquare away for Point Dalhousie. Phwat&#8217;s interferin&#8217;,
I dunno.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Canadian cruiser,&#8221; said Skeel with dry bitterness.
&#8220;Get aboard, anyway. We&#8217;ll have to wait for
dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a reluctant shuffle of feet, a careless adjusting
of green jackets and caps, a reaching for rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; whispered Barres, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to get
to the landing before they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>They turned and moved off swiftly among the trees.
Renoux saw them coming, understood, turned and hurried
southward to warn Alost and Souchez. Barres
and Westmore caught glimpses of them ahead, striding
along the trodden path under the trees, and ran
to overtake them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going aboard,&#8221; said Barres to Renoux.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
&#8220;But they will probably wait till dark before starting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will unless they&#8217;re stark mad,&#8221; said Renoux,
hurrying out to the southern borders of the wood.
But no sooner had he arrived on the edge of the open
swale country than he uttered an exclamation of rage
and disgust, and threw up his hands helplessly.</p>
<p>It was perfectly plain to the others what was happening&mdash;and
what now could not be prevented.</p>
<p>There lay the big, swift power boat, still at anchor;
there stood the ramshackle wharf and boat-house.
But already a boat had put off from the larger craft
and was being rowed parallel with the shore toward
the mouth of a marshy creek.</p>
<p>Two men were rowing; a third steered.</p>
<p>But what had suddenly upset Renoux was the sight
of a line of green jackets threading the marsh to the
north, led by Skeel, who was already exchanging handkerchief
signals with the men in the boat.</p>
<p>Renoux glanced at his prey escaping by an avenue
of which he had no previous knowledge. It was death
to go out into the open with pistols and face the fire
of half a dozen rifles. No man there had any delusions
concerning that.</p>
<p>Souchez had field-glasses slung around his neck.
Renoux took them, gazed at the receding boat, set his
teeth hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferez!&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Westmore, turning a violent
red.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man steering is Ferez Bey.&#8221; Renoux handed
the binoculars to Westmore with a shrug.</p>
<p>Barres, bending double, had gone out into the swale.
A thicket of cat-tails screened him and he advanced
very carefully, keeping his eyes on the green-jacketed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
men whose heads, shoulders and rifles were visible
above the swampy growth beyond.</p>
<p>Suddenly Renoux, who was watching him in bitter
silence, saw him turn and beckon violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; he said in a low, eager voice. &#8220;He may
have found a ditch to shelter us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Renoux was correct in his surmise: Barres stood
with drawn pistol, awaiting them in a muddy ditch
which ran through the reeds diagonally across the
marsh. It was shin-deep in water.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could make a pretty good stand in a ditch
like this, couldn&#8217;t we?&#8221; he demanded excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we can!&#8221; replied Renoux, jumping down
beside him, followed by Westmore, Alost and Souchez
in turn.</p>
<p>Barres, leading, ran down the ditch as fast as he
could, spattering himself and the others with mud and
water at every step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; panted Renoux, clambering nimbly out of
the ditch and peering ahead through the reeds. Then
he suddenly stood upright:</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;It&#8217;s all up with you, Skeel!
Keep away from that boat, or I order my men to
fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a dead silence for a moment; then Skeel&#8217;s
voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not bother us, my good man. We know our
business and you&#8217;d better learn yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skeel,&#8221; retorted Renoux, &#8220;my business is other
people&#8217;s business, sometimes. It&#8217;s yours just now. I
warn you to keep away from that boat!&#8221; He turned
and hailed the boat in the next breath: &#8220;Boat ahoy!
Keep off or we open fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The metallic bang of a rifle cut him short and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
straw hat was jerked from his head. Then came
Skeel&#8217;s voice, calmly dangerous:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you, Renoux! You have no standing here.
Keep away or I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What lawful standing have you&mdash;leading an armed
expedition from the United States into Canada!&#8221; retorted
Renoux, red with anger and looking about for
his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t get back I shall surely kill you!&#8221; replied
Skeel. &#8220;I count three, Renoux:&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three.&#8221;
Bang! went another rifle, and Renoux
shrugged and dropped reluctantly back into the ditch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Barres, fire across that
boat out yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Westmore also fired, aiming carefully at Ferez. It
was too far; they both knew it. But the ricochetting
bullets seemed to sting the rowers to frantic exertion,
and Ferez, at the rudder, ducked and squatted flat, the
tip of his hat alone showing over the gunwale.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stop them,&#8221; said Renoux desperately.
&#8220;They&#8217;re certain to reach that boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, suddenly, Skeel&#8217;s six rifles cracked viciously
and the bullets came screaming over the ditch.</p>
<p>Renoux fairly gnashed his teeth:</p>
<p>&#8220;If a bluff won&#8217;t stop them, then I&#8217;m through,&#8221; he
said bitterly. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any authority. I haven&#8217;t
the audacity to fire on them&mdash;to so insult your Government.
And yet, by God!&mdash;there&#8217;s the canal to remember!&#8221;</p>
<p>Another volley from the Green Jackets, and again
the whizzing scream of bullets through the cat-tails
above their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Barres. &#8220;They&#8217;re embarking already!
There isn&#8217;t a chance of holding them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was true. Pell-mell through the shallow water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
and into the boat leaped the Green Jackets, holding
their rifles high in the early sunshine; Skeel sprang
in last of all; the oars flashed.</p>
<p>Pistols hanging helplessly, Renoux and his men
stood there foolishly on the edge of their ditch and
watched the boat pull back to the big power-craft.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything. The Green Jackets climbed
aboard with a derisive cheer. So near was the power-boat
that Skeel, Ferez, and Soane were easily distinguishable
there in the brilliant sunshine, on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; burst out Renoux, &#8220;they&#8217;ll not dare lie
there at anchor and wait for dark, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the anchor came up.</p>
<p>Very deliberately the small boat was hoisted to the
davits; the big craft began to move, swinging her nose
north by west, the spray breaking under the bows.
She was already under way, already headed for the
open sea.</p>
<p>And then, without any warning whatever, out of
the northeast, almost sheering the jutting point which
had concealed her, rushed a Canadian patrol boat, her
forward deck a geyser of spouting foam.</p>
<p>A red lance of flame leaped from her forward gun;
the sharp crack shattered the summer stillness; the
shell went skittering away over the water, across the
bows of the power-boat; a string of signals broke
from the cruiser&#8217;s mast.</p>
<p>Then an amazing thing happened; the power-boat&#8217;s
after deck suddenly swarmed with Green Jackets; there
came a flash and a report, and a shell burst over the
Canadian patrol cruiser, cutting her halliards to ribbons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;by&mdash;God!&#8221; gasped Renoux. Barres and
Westmore stood petrified; but the three Frenchmen,
with one accord, and standing up very straight, uncovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
in the presence of these men who were about
to die.</p>
<p>Suddenly the power-boat broke out a flag at her
masthead&mdash;a bright green flag bearing a golden harp.</p>
<p>Again the small gun flashed from her after-deck;
another gun spoke with a splitting report from the
starboard bow; both the shells exploded close to the
patrol cruiser, showering her superstructure with
steel fragments.</p>
<p>And, as the concussions subsided, and the landward
echoes of the shots died away, far and clear from the
power-boat&#8217;s decks, across the water, came the defiant
chorus:</p>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p class='indent2'>&#8220;I saw the Shannon&#8217;s purple tide</p>
<p class='indent2'>Roll by the Irish town,</p>
<p>As I stood in the breach by Donal&#8217;s side</p>
<p>When England&#8217;s flag went down!&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div></div>
<p>They were singing &#8220;Green Jackets,&#8221; these doomed
men. Barres could hear them cheering, too, for a moment
only&mdash;then every gun aboard the flimsy little
craft spat flame at the big Canadian, and the bursting
shells splashed the water all around her with their
pigmy fragments.</p>
<p>Now, from the cruiser, a single gun bellowed. Instantly
a red glare wrapped the launch; there was a
heavy report, a fountain of rushing smoke and debris.</p>
<p>Against the infernal flare of light Skeel&#8217;s tall figure
showed in silhouette, standing there with hat lifted as
though cheering. Again, from the cruiser, a gun
crashed. Where the burning launch had been a horrible
flare shot up; and the shocking detonation rocked
land and sky. On the water a vast black cloud rested,
almost motionless; and all around rained charred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
things that had been wood and steel and clothing, perhaps&mdash;perhaps
fragments of living creatures.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>So passed into eternity Murtagh Skeel and his
Green Jackets, hurled skyward in the twinkling of an
eye on the roaring blast of their own magazine. What
was left of their green flag attained an altitude unparalleled
that sunny morning. But their souls soared
higher into that blinding light which makes all things
clear at last, solves all questions, all perplexities&mdash;which
consoles all griefs and quiets at last the bitter
mirth of those who have laughed at Death for conscience&#8217;s
sake.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Very slowly the dull cloud lifted from the sunlit
water. Dead fish floated there; others, half-stunned,
lay awash with fins quivering, or strove to turn over,
shining silver white in the morning sun.</p>

</div>
<p>The sun hung low over Northbrook hills as
Barres turned his touring car in between the
high, white service gates of Foreland Farms,
swung around the oval and backed into the garage.</p>
<p>Barres senior, very trim in tweeds, the web-straps
of a creel and a fly-book wallet crossing his breast,
glanced up from his absorbing occupation of preparing
evening casts on a twelve-foot, tapered mist-leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said absently, glancing from his son to
Westmore through his monocle, &#8220;where have you been
keeping yourselves all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all about it later, dad,&#8221; said Garry,
emerging from the garage with Westmore. &#8220;Where
is mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the kennels, I believe.... What do you think
of this cast, Jim?&mdash;a whirling dun for a dropper, a
hare&#8217;s ear for a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He checked himself; glanced
doubtfully at the two young men.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re somewhat muddy,&#8221; he remarked; and continued
to explore his fly-book for new combinations.</p>
<p>Westmore, very weary, started for the house; Garry
walked across to the kennel gate, let himself in among
a dozen segregated and very demonstrative English
setters, walked along the tree-bordered alley behind
the garage, and, shutting out the affectionate but
quarantined dogs, entered the kennels.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span></div>
<p>His mother, in smock and apron, and wearing rubber
gloves, was seated on the edge of a straw-littered
bunk, a bottle in one hand, a medicine-dropper in the
other. Her four-footed patient, swathed in blankets,
lay on the straw beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dear,&#8221; she said, looking up at her son,
&#8220;where have you been all night, and most of to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about it later, mother. There&#8217;s something
else I want to ask you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He fell silent,
watching her measure out fourteen drops of Grover&#8217;s
Specific for distemper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening, Garry,&#8221; she said, bending over the
sick pup and gently forcing open his feverish jaws.
Then she dropped her medicine far back on his tongue;
the pup gulped, sneezed, looked at her out of dull eyes
and feebly wagged his tail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to pull him through, Garry,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The other pups are doing well, too. But your sister
and I were up with them all night. I only hope and
pray that the distemper doesn&#8217;t spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at her son:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dear, what is it you have to ask me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, do you like Dulcie Soane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely know her yet.... She&#8217;s very sweet&mdash;very
young&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She looked intently at her tall,
unsmiling son. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t even know who she is,
Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her son bent down beside her and put one arm
around her shoulder. She sat quite motionless with
the bottle of Grover&#8217;s Specific in one rubber-gloved
hand, the medicine dropper poised in the other.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie&#8217;s name is Fane, not Soane. Her grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
was Sir Barry Fane, of Fane Court&mdash;an Irishman.
His daughter, Eileen, was Dulcie&#8217;s mother....
Her father&mdash;is dead&mdash;I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;this explains nothing, Garry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not explanation enough, mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it enough for you, my son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head slowly drooped. She sat gazing in silence
at the straw-littered floor.</p>
<p>He looked earnestly, anxiously at his mother&#8217;s face.
Her brooding expression remained tranquil but inscrutable.</p>
<p>He said, watching her intently:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure about myself until last night. I
don&#8217;t know about Dulcie, whether she can care for me&mdash;in
this new way.... We were friends. But I am
in love with her now.... Deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was one of the moments in his career which remain
fixed forever in a young man&#8217;s memory.</p>
<p>In a mother&#8217;s memory, too. Whatever she says
and does then, he never forgets. She, too, remembers
always.</p>
<p>He stood leaning over her in the dim light of the
kennel, one arm around her shoulders, waiting. And
presently she lifted her head, looked him quietly in
the eyes, bent forward very gently, and kissed him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Dulcie was not in the house, nor was Thessalie.</p>
<p>Barres and Westmore exchanged conversation between
their open doors while bathing and dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, Garry,&#8221; admitted the latter, &#8220;I feel all
shaken up, yet, over that ghastly business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I.... If they hadn&#8217;t died so gamely....
But Skeel was a <i>man</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet he was, crazy or sane!... What a pity!...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
And that poor devil, Soane! Did you hear them
cheering there, at the last? And what superb nerve&mdash;breaking
out that green flag!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And think of their opening on that big patrol
boat! They hadn&#8217;t a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had no chance anyway,&#8221; said Westmore.
&#8220;It meant execution if they surrendered&mdash;at least,
they probably thought so. But how do you suppose
that cowardly strangler, Ferez, felt when he realised
that Skeel was going to fight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He certainly got what was coming to him, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221; said Barres grimly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll tell Thessa, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I can find her,&#8221; nodded Westmore, giving
his fresh bow-tie a most killing twist.</p>
<p>He was ready before Barres was, and he lost no
time in starting out to find Thessalie.</p>
<p>Barres, following him later, discovered him on the
library lounge with Thessalie&#8217;s fair cheek resting
against his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m s-sorry!&#8221; he stammered, backing out, and very
conscious of Westmore&#8217;s unconcealed annoyance. But
Thessalie called to him in a perfectly calm voice, and
he ventured to come back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to tell Dulcie about this horrible affair?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not immediately.... Are you feeling all right,
Thessa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I had a horrid night. Isn&#8217;t it odd how a
girl can so completely lose her nerve after a thing is
all over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best time to lose it,&#8221; said Westmore.
And to Barres: &#8220;She&#8217;s bruised from head to foot
and her neck hurts yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; murmured Thessalie, looking smilingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
at her lover. Then they both glanced at Barres.</p>
<p>There was a silence. Side by side on the library
lounge they continued to gaze expectantly at Barres.
And when he got it into his head that this polite expectancy
might express their desire for his early departure,
he backed out again, embarrassed and
slightly irritated.</p>
<p>Thessalie called to him very sweetly:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are looking for Dulcie, I left her a few
minutes ago over by the wall-fountain in the rose arbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said, and turned back through the
hall, traversing it to the north veranda.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Dulcie in the garden or on the
lawn. He walked slowly across the clipped grass, beyond
the pool, and, turning to the right past a sun-dial,
stepped into the long rose-arbour. At the further end
of the blossoming tunnel he saw her seated on the low
wall in the rear of the tea-house. Her head was
turned toward the woods beyond.</p>
<p>When he was near her she heard him and looked
around, was on the point of rising, but something in
his expression held her motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Garry?&#8221;</p>
<p>He ignored the question, seated himself beside her
on the wall, and drew both her hands into his. He
saw the swift colour stain her face, the lovely, disconcerted
eyes lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you come back as you
promised?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you found me gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What could you have thought of me, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;my thoughts were&mdash;not very clear.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are they clearer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head remained lowered but she raised her grey
eyes to his. Her face had become very still and
white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dulcie,&#8221; he said under his breath, &#8220;I am in love
with you.... What will you do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, after a little while:</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what shall I do, Garry?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love me. Can you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&mdash;Dulcie Fane!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips stirred, but no sound came.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so wonderful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am just realising
that I began to fall in love with you a long time
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The declining sun sent a red shaft across the fields,
painting every tree-trunk, gilding bramble and brake.
A single ray touched the girl&#8217;s white neck and turned
her copper-tinted hair to burning gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you love me? Can you love me, that way, Dulcie?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose abruptly, and he rose too, retaining her
hands; but as she turned her head from him he saw
her mouth quiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest&mdash;dearest!&#8221; But she interrupted him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to tell you&mdash;that I don&#8217;t understand why
I should be called by my mother&#8217;s maiden name....
I w-want you to know that I <i>don&#8217;t</i> understand it ...
if that would make a difference&mdash;in your c-caring for
me.... And I wish you to know that&mdash;that I love
and worship her memory&mdash;and that I am happy and
proud&mdash;and <i>proud</i>&mdash;to bear her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My darling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Dulcie.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And do you still want me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You adorable child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Do</i> you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He caught her in his arms,
held her close, lifted her flushed face. &#8220;Now, tell me
whether you can love <i>me</i>! Tell me everything that&#8217;s
hidden in your mind and heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Garry,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;I do belong to you. I
belong to you anyway, because you made me. And
I&#8217;ve always been in love with you&mdash;always!&mdash;always
from the very beginning of the world, <i>Asthore</i>! And
now&mdash;if you want me&mdash;this way&mdash;Garry <i>mo veel
asthore</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her hands crept from his breast to his
shoulders; stole up around his neck. &#8220;Asthore,&#8221; she
murmured; and their lips met in their first kiss. Then
she gravely turned her head and laid her cheek against
his; and he heard her murmuring to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Drahareen o machree, mo veel asthore!</i> This man&mdash;this
man who takes my heart&mdash;and gives me
his....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you murmuring there all to yourself?&#8221;
he whispered, laughing and drawing her closer. But
she only clung to him passionately and her closed lids
kept back the starting tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, dear?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;H-happiness,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;and pride, perhaps.... And
my love for you, Asthore!&#8221;</p>
